<h2>Announcements</h2>
<p>I am hosting a Twitch lecture on Calculus on <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Calculus+Twitch+Stream&iso=20201227T14&p1=137"12/27/2020, 2 PM PST</a>.</p>
<p>The goal of this lecture is not to actually provide a rigorous introduction to calculus - we do not even mention the delta-epsilon of a limit - but rather to connect several pieces of calculus. We try to</p>

<ol>
<li>give the viewer a feel for what a derivative is, and how to compute one</li>
<li>give a natural explanation for Taylor Series, and solve the perennial mystery, "where the heck did the factorials in the denominator come from?"</li>
<li>take the formulas that Calculus BC makes you memorize, such as the chain rule, and show why they should be true.</li>
</ol>

<p>The lecture should take about 1.5 hours. After the lecture, I'll be playing Minecraft with viewers for about an hour (most likely Bedwars), answering any miscellaneous questions people have, and talking to chat.</p>
<p>The VODs of the stream can be found on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChpIX4Ue1DmLm8qeR0ANbRg">my YouTube channel</a> afterwards. My Twitch/YouTube also have a <a href="http://dsc.gg/chennis">Discord server</a> associated with it.</p>
