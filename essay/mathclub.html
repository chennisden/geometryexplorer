<p><em>First published January 1, 2021.</em></p>

<p>Those of you who've been following my website more closely may have noticed <a href="https://www.geometryexplorer.xyz/essay/appeal">a weird essay</a> on my website on October of last year. There's a large amount of missing context in this post that I'd elected to wait until after NARML to post. Since it's well after NARML and I have time, I thought I'd actually tie the analogy in to my main point - why a large number of school math clubs are failing, the misleading guiding principle that "math club is for everyone" [1], and some specific steps that can be taken to reverse this trend. This essay was spawned from a series of messages with the AoPS user <b>Frestho</b>.</p>

<h2>Prognosis</h2>

<p>Ever since the fall of my Freshman year, I had noticed that the high school math club had been in a state of disarray, particularly when compared to our middle school math team. Even before the onset of the coronavirus, the math team, to put it bluntly, didn't do all that much - the highly anticipated geometry bee had no progress made on it, the officers who I've spoken to didn't know what was going on or where everything was being kept, and despite the extraordinarily long list of AIME qualifiers at our school, we were able to fit everyone in a small classroom. This trend has been occuring in a number of non-elite schools other than my own, and its progression has serious implications for the mathematics contest scene.</p>

<p>I will be the first to admit that I stood to lose very little from this situation. I had the resources, connections, and experience to train on my own. The same holds for all of the other experienced math competitors - in other words, <i>the people in the best position to do something about this</i>. I don't believe this apathy stems from intentional selfishness or malice. I believe that the reason this trend is continuing is threefold: first, the scope that experienced math competitors are thinking through is larger than the scope casual hobbyists do, second, that said competitors have more options than hobbyists, and finally, how the leadership of math teams - intentionally or not - overcorrects for this gap. But it is this combination, along with the self-righteous efforts to "spread mathematics," obsession with short-term club popularity, and lack of long-term planning that spells the downfall of many formerly prestigious math clubs.</p>

<p>The solutions to outreach that most competent teachers and leaders will choose probably differs vastly from the idea of a school math club at lunch. I know that <a href="https://mast.geometryexplorer.xyz">I chose differently</a>. But at the same time, there is still a place for school math clubs, and crucially, a place for those who care enough to improve them.</p>


<h2>Mass Appeal</h2>

<p>Those of you who are officers at your school math club have probably internalized the following mindset: "Math club isn't just a place for math competitions!" [2] But it's not as simple as that, especially when - to somewhat loosely paraphrase Frestho - many of the members have strong chances of doing decently in math contests and benefitting from the experience; it's just that there's something blocking their interest, preventing them from getting the right kind of training, or the right mindset. I also contend that there is a correlation between being "good at math" (whatever this may mean for a pre-college student who hasn't really studied math formally) and decent contest performance. [3] In particular, people who watch videos like Mathologer or 3b1b have more of a broad and undefined interest in math, and I do think they would benefit from more of an intense concentration, like those found in math competitions. I do think there's value in holding lectures about non-competition math focused topics, but I still recommend more of an intensive focus; group theory, Catalan numbers, and a differentiation crash course are better topics than curiosities that people could find on their own. (Fun fact: the "focus units" I hold in MAST are named for this philosophy.)</p>

<p>The people you end up reaching through this mindset are mostly the disinterested folks who just occasionally watching a YouTube video at home, and you miss out on the people who actually do want to put in the work and think hard about math.</p>

<p>Given that this is a school math club and not a work of fiction, the way the tradeoff between mass appeal and deep/specific learning is handled and the costs and benefits of each option are much different. In particular I think the decision is much closer in this case, particularly because the opportunity for an in-person opportunity to discuss "trashy mathematics" is more scarce and valuable than an opportunity to read trashy fiction. But I do think people should consider leaning towards the other end of the spectrum, for a couple of reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>(This point is specific to the coronavirus pandemic.)  The in-person element is gone, so you don't get any points for that. If we simplify a little and judge overall value to be average impact * people attending, [4] the removal of the in person element goes down so much that you'll need very effective mass appeal to make up for it. If the normal "equation" looks like 5*30 and the new "equation" looks like 2*30 it is the leftmost number that needs to be optimized. After all, (2+5)* (30-10) > 2 * 30. Obviously, these numbers are made up and represent an oversimplication, but hopefully the point is more clear with some concrete numbers.</li>
<li>The number of casual math elements that exist out there is much greater than the number of serious competitive or deep math clubs and programs. Even if you're in the SFBA, your school may offer one of the only serious potential opportunities for many interested students. There are lots of people in my school who were interested in math competitions and only grew hesitant because it was clear that there were no free and easy to access groups in the vicinity, because the school math club we expected to fulfill this function has failed.</li>
<li>I don't think the math club should exist just to fulfill the purpose of having a school math club, and I strongly believe more meaningful things can come out of one. And the guaranteed way to make your math club "fail" is to give in to the fear of changing things too much.</li>
<li>This is my own philosophy to "Why math?" (or why anything in general), so it is more subjective than the other three points and may not hold as much weight. I think math competitions and math in general is rewarding because it gives you something concrete and uncontrived to strive for. Math in particular has a natural beauty that is unmatched by most other academic pursuits, and there is a reason that it is able to appeal to so many people without becoming worthless (and in fact more worthwhile) as a result of its popularity. Math (competitions) may be the first time a high-schooler feels a <i>drive</i> to learn and to work for something, and this is one of the most precious feelings you can learn while in school. This is why a serious math club far surpasses a casual one in terms of value. This is also why doing well in math contests is more rewarding than just participating in them.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'll tie back to fiction now - I don't think everyone will be into the same types of books that I read. But the people who are interested in something such as psychological horror would be much better off being recommended <i>good books</i>, rather than just the popular ones. [5] Math clubs in school are the same; math may not be for every student, but the ones that are there are mostly there because they want to give it a serious go, so I think it's worth just sending them down the deep end and letting them chase the rabbithole. The alternative is just treating them with kid gloves - and they aren't stupid. They'll know you aren't taking it seriously, and as a consequence, they won't take it seriously either. This is the worst of both possible worlds; you lose interest from the more casual kids - the hobbyists and enthusiasts - and you're regarded as a joke by the stronger contestants.</p>

<h2>Specific Steps</h2>

<p>In contrast with the above section, which is more general - it really only says "increase rigor" - I'll be presenting some specific examples of topics that I believe are really good for a math club. Most of these will naturally be combinatorially inclined because of a general lack of background.</p>

<p>A difference you should maintain between the school math club versus competition math classes is that in math club, you should aim to have everyone walk away with a good understanding of almost everything you've presented. This means that you should be somewhat conservative with the number of problems you present, and on most days, difficulty. Some competition math classes adopt the mentality of "throw stuff at the wall and hope some of it will stick." While I have mixed opinions on the efficacy of that approach, I know that the school math club is not the place for it. You want people to feel like they're welcome in the math club, and you don't want to discard the range of people you can attract for questionable benefit. While you do want people to feel challenged, they should not be feeling frustrated. ARML's philosophy of <a href="https://usamo.wordpress.com/2018/02/02/an-apology-for-hmmt-2016/">gimmes versus gettables</a> also is very helpful to have; to be explicit, I believe a school math club lecture should <i>only</i> consist of gettables.</p>

<p>A good topic also depends on how long your meetings are (in particular, if your club's meetings are less than an hour long, your club unfortunately can't do much of anything), but here are some specific topics which are interesting/novel enough for even the most seasoned of contestants yet are understandable by the majority of decently competent high-school students.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Group theory.</b> Although it's not an easy subject for high-schoolers by any means, it's useful and surprisingly intuitive.</li>
<li><b>USAMTS puzzles.</b> I would not rely on this too much, but it's good for filling in some meetings after intense events. (Think AMCs.)</li>
<li><b>Mock contests and discussion.</b> You can either mock old tests or AoPS contests - here are <a href="https://www.geometryexplorer.xyz/essay/mocks">a few mock contests I like</a>, which is only a subset of the abundance of treasure in the AoPS Mock Contests subforum.</li>
<li><b>Transformations in geometry.</b> Did you know that the area of the triangle formed by the medians of ABC has 3/4 the area of ABC? Unless you're already very experienced in math competitions, this obscure topic is probably not one you're very familiar with, but it is still approachable for those with less experience. (When I say transformations, I am referring to a particular class of problems that appears <i>in math contests</i>. Anyone interested in further details or obtaining the Transformations MAST Handout - a student favorite - should contact me.)</li>
<li><b>"Andy the Unicorn."</b> A topic that I can only describe as containing extremely aesthetic states problems - such problems include gems like <a href="https://www.geometryexplorer.xyz/pdfs/diagnosticquiz2021.pdf">MAST Diagnostic 2021/8</a>, <a href="https://services.artofproblemsolving.com/download.php?id=YXR0YWNobWVudHMvZi81L2IzYWJhYTRkZjNmODQ3ZmM3ZThjNzBlODk4NGU4OGRiYWFjMWZmLnBkZg==&rn=ZGlzY3Vzcy5wZGY=">a problem from my MATHCOUNTS tryouts</a> (warning: these are the solutions to the 2021 MAST Diagonstic, so do not open if you plan to apply), <a href="https://hmmt-archive.s3.amazonaws.com/tournaments/2003/feb/comb/problems.pdf">HMMT 2003/C10</a>, and <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h2369712">NARML 8</a>. I really like this topic in particular since the Andy problem was inspired by my experience with the MS MATHCOUNTS Tryouts problem and a penchant for misreading (I misread CMIMC Team 2019/7 and found an idea I deemed interesting), and NARML #8 was a problem originally too similar to Andy the Unicorn that got saved by a random suggestion (among a list of terrible suggestions) that I make the scientist loop through the number line, which somehow was enough to make something interesting and novel. This topic has a universal appeal in that it was so simple I could understand it as a 6th grader, yet the solverate on Andy the Unicorn is low enough to indicate that these types of problems are genuinely difficult. The reactions I got from the smart solution to Andy (instead of the disgusting recursions I had to read) indicated that this topic also really showcases the magic of mathematics quite well - that it's not just formulas, grinding, and manipulation, and that there are downright amazing shifts of perspectives that can be made.</li>
<li><b>Remainder Theorem.</b> This is something I think the underclassmen in Algebra 2 will appreciate knowing, and besides is a very cool topic with plenty of applications. Best of all, it builds on something that nearly everyone knows how to do: polynomial division.</li>
<li><b>Factoring.</b> The basics matter, and it's also quite satisfying to do.</li>
<li><b>Telescoping.</b> This is relevant to the upperclassmen in Calculus (think partial fraction decomposition), and is also just cool and satisfying.</li>
<li><b>USA TST Cars.</b> I know that nobody will solve this, but when you take the last 5 minutes of the meeting to explain it, everyone will be simultaneously amazed and annoyed by the solution.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will notice that I have barely included geometry in this list. I think that Geometry is too detail oriented for a school math club, which does not bode well for the folks who're trying to do well in the AMCs. I also think AoPS Introduction to Geometry is bad, and I would recommend EEG V2 but the problem is that it's targeted at a much higher level than people who're just beginning to prepare for AMCs would be comfortable with, and it's also not done.</p>

<p>As a final note, I think that assigning homework/reading should be done, but you should also stress that it's optional and there's no shame in not being able to find the time to brush up on your angle chasing before the officers present NARML #7, etc. That way the casual students have a comfortable place to go, but those who are more willing to put in effort can derive some additional value from the club without being made to feel bad if they start falling behind. (I also think lectures should be as disjoint as possible, with a few multiparters being reasonable.)</p>

<h2>Footnotes</h2>

<p>[1] I do not contest that people should be encouraged to pursue math - but as the rest of the essay will make clear, this mindset often comes to the detriment of all involved, including those who are more on the casual side of math.</p>

<p>[2] In all transparency, I am not an officer of my school math club (and nor does said math club even exist this year).</p>

<p>[3] I think the correlation is essentially binary; either you're a "math contest kid" or you're not. I don't think getting 8 on AIME vs. making Olympiad vs. making MOP makes as big a difference as making AIME vs. not doing math contests.</p>

<p>[4] Perhaps a more accurate formula is Delta-impact * people attending / time, where Delta-impact as how useful the lecture was compared to what would've happened if the kid didn't attend - in other words, opportunity cost. But in the case of school math clubs, Delta-impact is about the same as impact, since sitting around and eating lunch isn't particularly productive anyways. Time can be taken out since lunch is a fixed period of time anyway and we don't really need to measure a rate.</p>

<p>[5] In practice, there's significant overlap here. But I can think of several other genres where the most popular books are not the best ones, and I also can think of people who have negative impressions of the entire genre because of said popular books.</p>
