<h1>Group Theory</h1>
<p><em>Originally published on November 23, 2020. The title is a pun, and the contents of this essay have nothing to do with math.</em></p>

<p>Many students in high school dislike group work because it feels superficial, artificial, and uninteresting. But the group projects assigned have a more sinister effect: they provide a poor model of what doing real work is like, and the false impressions that school leave are not easily corrected.</p>

<h2>The Discrete Task Myth</h2>

<p>The first myth that school group work will tell you is that groups exist to complete a set of tasks. This means that you are given a task to do (never mind actually determining the task, which is the most important and difficult part in the real world), you figure out how to do it (which involves splitting it into several discrete tasks with little relation to each other), and then you never follow up on it again. The mantra is basically this: groups exist to do tasks.</p>

<p>But it turns out that it is the opposite that is true. Tasks exist to be done by groups. It should come as no surprise that MAC (our contest-writing group) has its projects bleed into each other. We take past experiences and leftover problems, save stuff for future projects it might fit better in, and consolidate all of these perspectives into our current vision. In fact, you'd probably consider this normal - what kind of successful group is so short-sighted as to refuse to consider the future? What kind of group would refuse to reflect on the past and grow from it?</p>

<p>What really should be surprising is that we're doing the opposite in school and that it's somehow considered normal. When's the last time the poor kid taking the project home didn't immediately trash it? When's the last time the members got together to think about the process, or heck, even the product?</p>

<p>Because the product exists only to net a grade, permanence is the last thing on anyone's mind. But quite surprisingly, the primary implications of this are about the people and the process, not the result.</p>

<p>It is our refusal to acknowledge that groups are meant to be long-term that causes toxic dynamics to form in the first place. When you know you're going to be done with the incompetent morons in your group after thirty minutes, or after a week, there is much less reason to resist calling them incompetent morons. I'm guilty of this too. Compromising is like playing a game of chicken: you don't want to cede any ground to the other person, but one of you has to do it in the end. But when ceding ground is the end of everything, and there's nothing to lose by figuratively flipping the birdie as you walk out and announce you no longer care, there's little incentive to create sustainable relationships. Over time this might turn into a reputation for being a "bad team worker" that follows the kid. But if we're not betting on the long term, what reason have we given students to care about it themselves?</p>

<p>It is the school's insistence that things such as team spirit or a vision matter that end up devaluing them. Kids are really good at detecting bullshit, and they can tell the adults aren't really convinced that these characteristics lead to good work; this culture of treating work like a grocery list was created by them because that's how they think. And this backfires especially hard because team spirit isn't something you can see from the outside.</p>

<p>A lazy person giving a speech on exercise might be uninspiring, but it doesn't do anything to lower someone's impression of exercise. There are people out there with muscles and there are people who can run a mile in less than five minutes, and as long as those people exist, the allure of becoming fit is still there. You can't be morbidly obese and claim that you're a fitness guru because there's an obvious contradiction. But if you're a drone who doesn't understand the appeal of work at all and you give a speech on the value of having a vision in your work, the contradiction is less obvious. A visionary can really only be appreciated by other visionaries, and when soulless administrators and counselors keep telling us the value of vision when they themselves have none, it becomes hard not to see "vision" as a cop-out. When it becomes increasingly easy for posers to claim that they're a good motivational speaker, the value of the intangible concepts they speak of tend to be diminished.</p>

<p>And this isn't some sort of horror story where the evil administrators deliberately raise another generation of out-of-touch people. And if they are evil, it's only because they so adamantly refuse to let go of their positions because their ego wouldn't be able to take the fall. They would like for kids to genuinely be inspired, but they don't know how, and at some point keeping the six-figure salary becomes more important than instilling a concept that might not even exist.</p>

<p>But I still haven't touched on the biggest part of this myth. It's that groups intentionally form for a well-defined purpose, where each member of the team is specifically picked for their talents. For especially important operations, this is true - but the chances of you only participating in these sorts of groups are low. So it's important to understand that the majority of groups form spontaneously.</p>

<p>This spontaneity is fueled by existing connections. Every startup founder invited their co-founders because he or she knew them from before. Most teams for math contests are formed on the basis of friendship and familiarity. MAC may have been formed out of the blue, with no inherent motivation other than "eh, why the heck not?" But a large number of the founding members were part of the same team on the Online Math Open last year, and people knew each other from the past in other ways as well. This is why it's so hard to start a conversation with someone when you're the new kid in school; it takes so much effort to get the sparks flying. The first words you say to a stranger take so much more courage and effort than the rest combined, so if you're going to make connections, you should definitely be encouraged to maintain them.</p>

<p>As someone who has frequently been forced to micromanage groups (even some that have been formed with no relation to school), it's very liberating to see how a real group functions. Everyone ends up doing something out of their own free will, and because of that, we gain a lot of perspective by just pushing forwards. It's actually quite liberating to be freed of the concept that groups just have to do tasks, whether they like it or not. I'd never known what exactly I was missing until I was able to work with a competent group. But if other people know what to actively look for in a group, then I suspect that they'll be able to internalize their own perspective much faster. Just knowing the name of what you're fighting makes beating it so much easier, and this demon is one of the most fulfilling ones to slay.</p>

<p>The worst consequence of the short-term approach to group work is that everything is viewed in the lenses of practice. You're practicing how to compromise, they say. You're practicing how to divide work up, how to plan, and how to compromise. And you're doing this so one day, when you're actually someone intelligent and useful to society, you'll be able to seamlessly transition from the misleading experience of school to what the real world has to offer.</p>

<p>Can you imagine if your coach told you just to practice the motions and steps of running - forget actually running - so you'll be ready for your first track meet after ten years? Can you imagine if your boyfriend told you that he'd practice falling in love with you so he can be ready to get a wife ten years later? You can't learn to run without running, you can't learn to love without loving, so how can you learn to work without actually doing anything meaningful?</p>

<h2>The Equivalent Exchange Myth</h2>

<p>The other pernicious lie that school perpetuates is that every member of a group must equally contribute to every project. You'll even hear teachers say "leave some work for Alex, so he can do his fair share." And it's the reality that people don't always split the work equally that makes us covet this ideal even more. School leads us to believe that collaboration ought to be something where everyone inputs the same amount of effort and gets the same reward.</p>

<p>But not only is this ideal impossibly idealistic, it's not even desirable to begin with. Group work being "fair" not only gets in the way of doing meaningful work, but more crucially, it fails to recognize that the strength of a group is in its diversity. Trying to get everyone to do the same amount of work gets people begin to measuring themselves against each other, even if there is no apt comparison to be made.</p>

<p>Take the following situation as an example: consider a small online math program run by five or so high schoolers. One of them is the founder and is in charge of the main curriculum design and public relations. The other three do the grunt work: they do the grading, edit the handouts, and collect problems for future handouts. And the last one just made the website. It's very tempting to characterize the last one as a freeloader. He took a minor role, finished the website in two weeks, and just has to maintain it. And for such a small investment of time, he ends up getting more publicity than the graders, who've had to dedicate hundreds of ! How unfair.</p>

<p>But that way of thinking isn't going to get you people with diverse skills - or people at all, for that matter. [1] The story about Picasso said it best: "The sketch may have taken me five minutes, but the learning took me 30 years." And this is where schools do students the greatest disservice. For all the talks about diversity, it's near worthless in the classroom. Trying to compare people against each other requires using the same scale, and when school has total control of what that scale is, what we get is a one-dimensional measurement of someone's aptitude. Alice isn't a student who understands people well and can encourage them anymore, and Bob isn't someone who has a deep understanding of calculus anymore. Instead, we have this:</p>

<p>Alice's communication skills > Bob's communication skills</p>
<p>Bob's calculus grade > Alice's calculus grade</p>

<p>When we only measure the second one, we're sending the message that communication skills don't matter and that your ability to answer 25 derivative questions in 70 minutes is all that does. And it all stems from <a href="/essay/perverse">grades.</a> It wouldn't be so bad if Alice had a chance of having a higher grade than Bob at science or history. [2] But Bob has learned how to game a system, and if all of Bob's grades are better than Alice's, good luck convincing her that she's worth just as much as Bob.</p>

<p>This sort of measurement doesn't just send Alice the message that she's dumb. It also sends Bob the message that he's better than everyone else. So Alice doesn't study enthusiastically anymore, because she's never going to have the same skills as Bob anyway, and Bob doesn't stop being a jerk until he's in his thirties and his bad habits from school have been overwritten, because look how far being nice has gotten Alice. [3]</p>

<p>The equivalent exchange myth has gotten so bad that we're no longer satisfied with everyone putting the same amount of effort into the project; now we want people to put the same type of effort in the same period of time. It's no wonder that kids think group projects are so pointless: if you can't apply your skills and you're being told that what makes you special is actually irrelevant, of course you're going to play games during class instead. And even for the people who have the willpower to push through, they never make a product worth revisiting and learn nothing from it.</p>

<p>Group projects are a chance for people to learn about themselves, to learn from each other, and to learn how to prioritize certain things in life. It's about time schools stop taking all three of these away from students.</p>

<h2>Footnote</h2>

<p>[1] And even if you could somehow quantify the amount of value someone brought to a project, you'd still lose out on something: perspectives. The perspectives of people who've worked closely with a project are bound to be different from the more impartial viewpoint of an outsider. MAC has testsolvers to address our biases. Think of it this way: If you produce something good, then the first impression is going to be "this is good," and the reviewer is going to try and convince themselves to make that feeling stronger. But along the way, they'll run into a couple of bumps that they just can't shake off: perhaps a problem that's bad, or some awkward phrasing. Then these bumps get reported, and you'll be able to fix them to make a more seamless product.</p>

<p>This isn't just true for math contests, but also for fiction as well. When my friends send me a promising story, I'm immediately able to spot what breaks my immersion and ticks me off. But if I were just as emotionally invested as they were, then I too would've convinced myself that these rough spots didn't actually exist.</p>

<p>This is also why people talk in general; they want to validate their perspectives and fix any minor flaws it might have. This is why you have to be careful when you fundamentally disagree with someone on something controversial, and this is also why I've always been saying that someday teachers will be glad their students talked so much in class - because people learn so much from interacting with each other. But I'm sure they've learned this after Zoom classes.</p>

<p>All of this seems so obvious in retrospect that you might wonder why I'm even saying any of this to begin with. But this just shows how deep-seated the issue is. When you're making a group poster there's nobody in your group that can offer objective feedback on the poster, and when you try to trade posters with another group to get feedback, the teacher admonishes you for working outside your assigned group. None of this is on purpose.</p>

<p>[2] Actually, it <i>is</i> bad that Bob (a stand-in for your average STEM kid) doesn't have the same grades Alice does in certain classes. Especially when this class is English.</p>

<p>A large number of math students have been turned off of writing because they don't think it's "for them," and to protect their egos, they naturally devalue the process. This is why you hear a lot of younger students going around and saying "writing is stupid."</p>

<p>[3] Successful people are usually nice. Bob may be considered successful, but that's only by the school's standards - and <a href="/essay/mediocrity">school has success wrong</a> anyways.</p>
