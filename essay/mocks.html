<h1>Mock Contest Recommendations</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated August 29, 2020.</em></p>
  <h2>Mock Contest Philosophy</h2>
  <p>Not all mock contests are created equal; in fact, the vast majority of mock contests are not good, and a sizeable portion of them have absolutely no value. However, there are some contests that are off only by feel or difficulty, rather than quality, and worth using as practice problems. Even better, there are some contests that are so accurate and good that they're just as good as or better than the real thing.</p>
  <p>Particularly for the AMCs, the real thing is not always the best for prepartion. In fact, only post 2017 AMC contests are even close to what would show up on the AMCs today. The people who declare "mock contests are inaccurate, use the real thing" are right, but only to an extent; avoiding mock contests and only using real contests for "practice" often leads to a mentality of "saving tests" (i.e. avoiding doing problems and instead trying to figure out which tests are best to do when), which leads to getting nothing done and not improving. I also think mock contest results and practice test results are both close to worthless.</p>
  <p>I am not suggesting you do not do older AMCs for practice. It can help you get a sense of testing strategy and solving more problems is always good. I do, however, strongly caution against <a href="/essay/diminish">consciously deciding to do all past AMCs</a>.</p>
  <p>If you are an older student with little competition experience, you will find the pool of good AMC 12 mocks is restrictively small. This is one of my frustrations with math contest culture towards older students, but the only thing that you can do about it is to take AMC 10s and ARMLs. (I also think this is fine when you're at "AMC 10 level.")</p>
  <p>The <a href="https://mac.geometryexplorer.xyz">MAC</a>  ensures that all of our contests have an amazing feel and accurate difficulty, so all MAC contests will be on this page as well.</p>

<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<p>These recommendations are made in roughly decreasing order, with my personal favorites on top for each section.</p>
<h3>AMC 10/12</h3>
<p><b><a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c594864h2164953_jmc_10_released_july_mock_amc">JMC 10</a></b> - The MAC's mock AMC 10 held in July 2020. Based on the feedback recieved, this is one of the few mock AMCs recently that managed to accurately capture the difficulty and feel of a modern AMC.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c594864h1710983">Autumn Mock AMC 10</a></b> - Perhaps one of the largest groups to ever write a Mock AMC. The many perspectives along with the voting system contributed to making a mock with many wonderful questions, which years later I still come back to for my handouts.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c594864h1967029">CMC Year 3</a></b> - A group of AMC mocks made by the CMC committee, a group of established problem-writers with some of the most popular mock contests on AoPS.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c594864h2159345">Scrabbler's AMC, Year 2</a></b> - Scrabbler's 2nd year of running biannual mock AMC contests, which improved on many of the flaws from the first year's mocks. The AMC 10 faced a few criticisms in difficulty, and the AMC 12's difficulty was much more iffy.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c594864h1984167">January Mock AMC</a></b> - A mock AMC hosted by P_Groudon in 2020. The last three or so problems are much weaker than the other mocks, but usually the last few problems on a mock don't matter as much because less people get to them anyways.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c594864h2093965">2020 CMC ARML</a></b> - ARML made by the CMC committee, a group of established problem-writers with some of the most popular mock contests on AoPS. The reason I'm rating it so low is because it's not an AMC, but note that an ARML is by nature approachable, so it's definitely still very worth doing.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c594864h1569848">Scrabbler's AMC, Year 1</a></b> -  Though this test misses on catching the feel of an AMC by a little bit, the difficulty and quality of the test is good enough to make the score you get from it as helpful as any other mock contest listed here.</p>
<h3>AIME/Olympiad</h3>
<p><b><a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c594864h2151878_sjmo_released_mock_aime__usajmo_2020_summer_math_competitions">SMC</a></b> - An AIME, USAJMO, and USAMO mock. Unfortunately SMO Problem 2's official solution is incorrect and it's fairly likely that the difficulty is actually much harder than appropriate, but the rest of the problems of the SMO are worth sitting down and doing.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c594864h2043263">Fake USA(J)MO 2020</a></b> - A mock USAJMO and USAMO, consisting of some overlapping problems. I thought Day 2 of the USAJMO was quite easy.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c594864h2042592_test_released_1st_annual_mock_usajmo">April Mock USA(J)MO</a></b> - A mock USAJMO written by a subset of the SMC group. Spoiler: The first problem is kind of a meme.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c594864h1967029">CMC Year 3</a></b> - A group of AMC mocks made by the CMC committee, a group of established problem-writers with some of the most popular mock contests on AoPS. I thought their AIME I was much better than their AIME II, with one stupid problem putting me off of the AIME II very strongly. I also found the JMO to have a similar feel to the JJMO written by members of the OTSS group.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c594864h2167348_deux_mathematics_olympiad_mock_usajmo_amp_usamo__problem_released">DeuX MO</a></b> - A mock USA(J)MO with disjoint problems. For some reason, my problem made it on as JMO 5.</p>
