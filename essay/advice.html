<h1>Giving Advice</h1>
<p><em>Originally published on December 7, 2020.</em></p>

<p>Good advice isn't as simple as saying something true. Obviously, the fact that I am wearing a grey jacket as I sit in front of my computer to type this essay is not good advice, even if it is true. And good advice is not merely meaningful, because the statement "the Earth orbits the Sun" and "(name)'s presidency was an unqualified disaster" do not constitue advice. In fact, I don't even think advice needs to be meaningful, and if I'm feeling particularly daring, it doesn't even need to be based on truthful information. What really separates advice from a true statement is that <i>it is actable on</i>. So if the important component of advice is how it's acted on, then that leaves two important questions for any piece of advice: Is the action it promotes good or bad, and how long does it take before you can act on it?</p>

<h2>Active vs. Passive Advice</h2>

There are two types of advice: active and passive advice. Speaking very roughly, active advice is advice that you can act on within a semi-definite timeframe. "Study for the final" would be active advice, since I know when the final is, and all I have to do is flip to page X of textbook Y used for class Z. Perhaps more specifically would be "study for your math final." More specifically would be "study page 107 of the textbook and do problems 9, 10, and 11 to review Taylor Series." <i>But the advice is all fundamentally the same,</i> because you're explicitly acting off of it. When you open the textbook, one of the reasons is that you're studying for the final.

Passive advice is more tricky, since it goes by many different names, like principles and morals. Regardless of what you want to call it, passive advice isn't something you explicitly act on. This is why I hate all of the "how to be a hero" videos that tell you "to actively look for opportunities to be a hero." Unless you're impossibly narcissitic and you think life is a TV show, there's no way you could take something so stupid seriously. But that doesn't mean the message should be discounted, because if active advice is the force that moves you, passive advice is the laws of physics which the forces obey. You're studying because your teacher reminded you about the final, but the reason the reminder's even effective is because you value education.

Right now the difference has just been presented as short-term versus long-term. Perhaps you might not even be convinced that active vs. passive advice is even a good way to look at it. But the reason I specifically call it active and passive advice is because of <i>how it's given</i>: actively and passively.

Active advice is likely to be directed towards a specific person or group of people; when you tell your friend Joe to "go back to base" because "red inc," you're giving active advice. It's the type that you're going to be giving someone when they do something you disagree with (or more often, don't do something that you think they should). It's also the advice that I think people are the worst at giving, because active advice <i>usually has to be intentionally useful</i> - in other words, you should have a clear idea of what you think someone should <i>do</i>, not just how you feel about the situation.

<p>Passive advice is very tricky to give, particularly because you're giving it to a lot of people. Whether it's the posters in the school halls or the essays on this website, there's an important trade-off that has to be made: <a href="http://paulgraham.com/useful.html">you have to trade specificity and strength for whether they'll listen or not</a>. This is seriously hard to do, and I'm not here to tell you how to attain this balance. But I am here to tell you that the reason it's important to word things as nicely as possible is because aside from being kind, <i>you're also making the tradeoff easier on yourself</i>.</p>

<h2>Good Advice</h2>

<p>If you're deciding whether you should give something as advice or not, <b>you can really boil the two questions down into one</b>: are you providing a better alternative?</p>

<p>Even though there are very few situations where it's necessary or even beneficial to take an all-or-nothing approach, it is often how people think. So you have to make sure you aren't saying anything extra, anything you can't justify. This is especially the case when you're giving advice; the human instinct to give advice is <i>most powerful when people observe a lapse in judgment.</i> I generally prefer to look at things through a merit system, where fulfilling one of a list of positive items means it has value. But advice is something that absolutely has to be looked at through the lens of a de-merit system, where one negative - in this case, an extraneous statement - is enough to disqualify the whole thing.</p>

<p>This is where middle school got it wrong with its "THINK" acronym: <i>they made too strong of a claim</i>. Certainly it's good to say things that are true, helpful, and inspiring - <i>this is pretty much equivalent to what I'm saying right now</i>. But middle school went a step too far. We would be good people if we only gave advice, and you could argue that what we said would still have the same substance. But could you imagine how boring someone would be if they never made small talk? If they deliberated everything they said before they said it? The answers to these questions are obvious, and when posters are unable to draw the nuance between small-talk or banter and advice, kids aren't in the wrong for disregarding them entirely.</p>

<p>It is good to know how to give advice, but there's a misconception that people are somehow <i>supposed to</i> always be conscious of what they're saying. But that seems terribly inefficient. Instead of fighting against your habits, <i>change them</i> - so that you can say good things because you're a smart person, not because you used some smarmy acronym list that somebody else made.</p>

<p>This is also why I strongly dislike claims of the form "to teach X you must have qualified for Y" (where X and Y are most commonly replaced with "AMC 10" and "USAJMO"), which is usually a common response to someone poorly managing/teaching a program or writing a book/handout. I don't think these statements are even remotely true, but that's not the reason that I think they're so damaging. <i>It's because the alternative being provided is to give up.</i> (And I think it's a good thing that people don't just give up when someone else tells them to.)</p>

<p>It's also why I think the only criticisms of an expository work that are <i>objectively justifiable</i> are on the factual level. I will not feel offended if you tell me that I replaced the word "volume" with the word "area," because that says nothing about my design philosophy, only my inability to remember the right terms, and fixing this error is objectively good. But that doesn't mean you should always play it safe. There are some potentially emotionally charged claims that are <i>probably</i> worth making - "this seems to be a list of facts, and has no unifying perspective," for instance, is something that can be address. But "wait until you've made AIME to make a handout," which essentially is the same as "give up (for now?)," does not help anyone. All that will accomplish is getting someone to ignore the rest of your advice.</p>

<h2>Footnotes</h2>

<p>[1] I've noticed that there also is a trend of people asking each other for their qualifications. It's pretty obvious that they're doing it because they want to find more places to one-up the poor kid posting the handout, and I feel like these people are completely missing the point of harsh wording: <b>it's to counteract actively harmful advice</b>. And the reason my posts work isn't because they're mean, it's because they have <i>substance</i>.

<br> Part of me is snarky enough to want to ask, "what are your qualifications for asking other people's qualifications?"</p>
