<h1>Perverse Incentives</h1>
<p><em>Originally published October 7, 2020.</em></p>

<p>I've made it no secret that I despite school despite being interested in almost every subject that is taught in it. While the insipid and uninspired nature of most classes being the norm is what directly causes school to be so unpleasant, it is just a symptom of the underlying problem: a misaligned incentive structure.</p>

<h2>Grades and Tests</h2>
<p>In an ideal world, the people who taught students would not be the same as those who judged them. But this is not an ideal world, and when the arbiters of our aptitude end up monopolizing the education sphere while falling out of touch with what is even being taught in the first place, it is hard to argue that teachers - those most in touch with the material being taught - should not be the ones giving the tests. So why is it that even when our teachers are the ones writing our tests, we are still failing to learn and be challenged? It is because fundamentally, <b>all of our learning opportunities are primarily meant to serve as judgement</b>, and only incidentally are meant as teaching moments.</p>

<p>This system shifts our priorities from learning into the appearance of learning, and when tests are so easily <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/lesson.html">hackable</a>, the two may as well be completely orthogonal to each other. This would be fine if grades had no impact, because then the perverse incentives to feign learning would not exist. But the magnitudes of the effects of these judgements have prevented even the most eager students from taking risks. When the most talented mathematicians in the classroom are slogging through routine exercises and the brilliant writers are producing vacuous essays, what does that bode for the novice mathematicians or the amateur writers?</p>

<p>We see a trend of students opting not to take risks, and increasingly the creativity and expressiveness of their works tend to go down, despite the fact that many have learned new concepts and have more interesting ideas to share. In fact, students are actively <b>avoiding</b> learning from their teachers, because the fact that they didn't know something already is followed by punishment. And this isn't just reflected in school - the personal ambitions of a disturbing number of students are being stifled. "There are a no stupid questions" is a lot less convincing when it's followed by "but the kid next to you is smarter because he didn't have to learn this from school."</p>

<p>Fortunately, many teachers have recognized this and begun grading things for completion. While this is still bad in that it encourages half-hearted and shoddy work and necessitates assigning meaningless busywork, it at least does not actively penalize eager students.</p>

<h2>Cheating</h2>
<p>I have lots of issue with the proselytizers who condemn cheaters as lazy, honest, or manipulative. [1] In particular, a significant portion of cheaters do intend to learn from the test or assignment they cheated on, and if the risk was low enough for them, they would likely not cheat. [2] If cheating is the only way for students to accept any sort of formative feedback, then it is incredibly difficult to blame those who have done it for this purpose. Not everyone is academically privileged enough to find sources of feedback outside of school, and not everyone is so intelligent that they can afford to take every exam with honesty, particularly when so many of them can feel so unfair. The decision for most people between integrity and grades is not always so clear, and the moral pretention by the people who do have the ability to make this decision easily reeks of uncanny and unjustified arrogance.</p>

<p>Those who are kept insulated from having to choose between a rock and a hard place and condemn the decisions of those who do are those who generally make the selfish or cowardly decisions when it is their turn. Those who condemn cheaters as people and claim to be morally superior are either too stupid to understand the situation that a large number of American youth are placed in, so intelligent that the thought or necessity of cheating has never crossed their minds, or a liar. And I strongly doubt that the second reason is the case.</p>

<h2>Footnotes</h2>
<p>[1] This is not to say that I condone cheating, and in particular, I condemn cheating in math contests <i>and the people who do this</i> because math contests do not have these perverse incentives and because there is no possible way that the negative effects of a math contest can follow you around <i>the same way a bad grade can</i>. (There are obviously exceptions even here, but in practice it is extremely implausible that people who cheat on math competitions have some reasonable explanation.) I am just skeptical of the people who choose to condemn all cheaters.</p>
<p>[2] This is also the reason people copy homework off of each other - it is because they see it as meaningless busywork. The validity of their beliefs does not matter because it is potentially affecting their education, so it does no good to blame these people <i>even if they are in the wrong</i>. Who is education supposed to <i>serve</i> in the first place - the students or the interests of bureaucracy?</p>
