<h1>A Utopian Proposition</h1>
<em>Originally published January 27, 2020.</em>

<p>The most common complaint in high school is that "schools is boring." And the second most common complaint is that "my teacher sucks." But what if I told you there was a way to address both of these in one fell swoop? [1]</p>

<h2>The Proposition</h2>

<p>The easiest way to address the second complaint is to give students some choice as to which teachers they have. But the laws of supply and demand imply an obvious conclusion - everyone's going to want the good teachers, and not everyone is going to get them. The way we determine who gets "first pick" - in other world, who this system prioritizes - says a lot about our priorities.</p>

<p>In the marketplace, the distinguishing factor is the amount of money you have and are willing to pay for something. And, as we can see from the college application process, the people who are smart and rich are prioritized. [2] This doesn't just start at college - better zip codes have better schools, and smarter kids take better classes. Can we do better?</p>

<p>I think we can, and I think we ought to. Choosing a criteria to measure students with is different from choosing a criteria to measure plants with; the plant doesn't care if you're measuring how tall it is or how many leaves it has, and it'll just grow in the way most conducive to its survival. [3] But <i>people</i> care about the criteria they're measured by, because <i>adjusting for them is conducive to survival</i>, among other things. The way we're measuring students <i>changes the way they develop,</i> and when they're at the point where the magnitude of their development is the greatest, even the slightest shifts in trajectory can have lasting effects.</p>

<p>It's arrogant of us to think we can predict the way people's lives will go through the first few years of their lives, which is what grades and standardized testing try to do. But perhaps we can, on a small scale, encourage students to give back to their community.</p>

<p>So here's the utopian proposition: What if we had teacher choice, and the students we prioritized were the ones who had more volunteer hours?</p>

<p>There's a thousand different ways the details could be taken care of. Perhaps kids could be separated into "tiers" of priority based on the number of hours they volunteered last year, much like how the Presidential Service Awards are given out. Or they could "spend" their hours based on how many classes they wanted to choose a teacher for, and the highest bidders would have first priority in the case a teacher is so popular all their seats are "bought." Perhaps there would be some sort of exemption for the economically struggling. The details aren't important right now; the point is that such a future is very easy to imagine.</p>

<h2>The Power of Agency</h2>

<p>When students claim that school is boring, what they really mean is that it's monotonous - the same thing over and over. And the root cause of this is a lack of <b>choice</b>.</p>

<h2>Motivations</h2>

<p>I can already see the biggest - and uncoincidentally, the most absurd - objection to this idea from 'purists.' "The kids will just volunteer to get good teacher!" they say, ignoring that college is already a strong incentivizer of doing good for the sake of something else.</p>

...

<p>The reason this line of argument is so fundamentally flawed, however, is because even if it was true to a significant extent, <i>it's okay for people to start out with impure motivations</i>. In the world of math contests, there are a good number of egotistical contestants who only compete for self-vindication. But I would never wish to "police" such motivations. [4] The same is true here. And anyway, I don't think being able to choose the teachers you get is going to be enough to volunteer for forty hours or whatever. It <i>is</i>, however, enough to get them started - which is exactly the point.</p>

<h2>Footnotes</h2>

<p>[1] Unfortunately, said solution is on a systemic scale, rather than an individual one. It is also an <i>eccentric</i> one, so the probability of it happening is approximately zero. But I do think it's an interesting thought exercise nonetheless.</p>

<p>[2] Though we <i>seem</i> to be moving away from the latter, <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/2017-09-20/see-20-years-of-tuition-growth-at-national-universities">the data suggests otherwise</a>.</p>

<p>[3] Actually, this isn't true if said trait (say, size of tomatoes) is selected for. Which makes my analogy even better - we're <i>selecting for "intelligence"</i> the same way we <i>select for traits</i> in a plant. But the definition of "intelligence" schools have is ridiculously narrow.</p>

<p>[4] This is the sort of lesson people have to learn on their own anyway; if you're going to proselytize, you're preaching to the choir.</p>
