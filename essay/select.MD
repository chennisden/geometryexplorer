# Select For People Who Care

*First published June 20, 2021.*

This essay is written primarily for high-schoolers aiming to form their own organization, The most significant implication of running an organization in high-school is that nobody is expected to pay their own bills, so this advice probably won't hold out in the "real world" (i.e. where money is involved).

## What We're Selecting For

"Select for people who care" is advice so obvious that it seems pointless. (It's not like the alternative is particularly viable.) But obvious doesn't mean automatic. Breathing is automatic in the sense that you don't need to remind yourself to do so. But selecting for people who care is not so automatic. And breathing is different in another sense: you fail to breathe by not breathing. It's an error of omission. But this is an error in focus, and it occurs when you're too concerned about selecting for *other* things.

What most people are selecting for now is prestige. There are some names that are more desireable, frequently because of the accomplishments attached to them. (Other factors are also at play.)

Whatever the case, prestige is a bad predictor of contribution. But it is not only bad to recruit for prestige. It is actively dangerous to construct an organization this way.

There's nothing tying a list of big names together. The atmosphere can turn sour very fast. It's easy for factions to blame each other for the organization's faults, and that's assuming the group gets off the ground to begin with. The traditional model of people uniting in the face of a common goal only works because the alternative is not something they can afford. But in high school, where everyone is part of three or four such organizations, the alternative is to just pour your efforts somewhere else.

Prestige is also one of the worst predictive indicators you could use. Trying to judge someone's future contributions to your organization based off of their past contributions to a different organization is surprisingly ineffective because of an idea called organizational context, which states that factors such as someone's relative position, the people they know, and the overall atmosphere of the group will affect the work they do and their interactions with their teammates. (More on this later.) It also gives the public the perception that you are just chasing clout or college. [1](#footnote1)

Some people try to bypass this and select directly for people who will put in work for the organization. But this is also wrong, and it is flawed in a much more subtle way than searching for prestige.

Almost always, what people look at is the amount of effort people are willing to put in at the moment of recruiting because it's the only thing you can directly observe. This is usually deceptively high because novelty is always an exciting concept. But you're not trying to run a group on this feeling novelty because it lasts for about a week or two. That's also about how long it'll take them to get settled and start working for real.

It's not a completely useless measure. Interest in the first few months usually models a non-increasing graph. If someone doesn't care even *with* the novelty, then you know they aren't someone you want to add to your group. But it's unlikely to give anything beyond the obvious.

The fact that interest is non-increasing is why it is so important to maintain interest. To take a math analogy: instead of looking at f, you should be looking at f'. From a logistical perspective, you have to give people a reason to care. So instead of making people jump through hoops to get to you in the first place and wasting their effort when they could be working on your project, try to make sure the project is accessible to them, and above all, make sure they can see that everyone else cares. [2](#footnote2)

The cynical part of me suggests that there are some people who do this because they view people as vats of productivity, rather than people with their own motivations. And if they do acknowledge these separate motivations, their main goal usually ends up as "manipulate or steer these motivations for my own benefit," rather than "understand their motivations and desires." They generally try to get people to do work by pestering them with a large number of mundane tasks or reminders. [3](#footnote3)

I think most people who do this are afraid or averse to getting their own hands dirty. Maybe they have the conception that leaders aren't supposed to do grunt work; on the outside, the rich CEO of every tech company appears to be focused on "big picture thinking." [4](#footnote4) They often forget that someone had to put in the work to elevate the company in such a position, or try to assign the responsibility to someone else.

This isn't exactly the same as as a refusal to put in effort. Rather, it's a fear of putting effort in the places where they failed before. In fact, I would say that most people insecure about their organizations should really hold off on the recruiting and start thinking about how to get people to care first. Adding people to do work doesn't really work when the organization resembles a ghost town. This is especially true when they are not being paid, because they are under no obligation to return any of your messages or even pretend to care.

I'd hazard that a high school organization doesn't even need applications. By their very nature, applications make the mistakes I've mentioned before. [5](#footnote5) But my experience here may not be entirely accurate: my work has been in math, which has a significantly larger than average community, and I also happen to be well connected. If you need people *and have a clear idea on how they would help*, I would just open applications. Better to take a risk than to fail for sure. [6](#footnote6)

But you shouldn't dogmatically reject the idea of applications, just like you shouldn't insist that everyone joins through the application process. There is a time and place for them. [7](#footnote7)

The most insidious selection criteria has to be fairness. On the surface it sounds very nice. Everyone deserves a chance to work with you if they possess a sufficient level of skill, maturity, etc. But that's not the way the real world works.

By fairness I mostly mean "internal consistency." But there are other aspects of fairness that I dislike: what if some previously unpleasant person claims they will change for the better, and thus, they deserve the chance to apply to your organization? Or what if someone has been unpleasant towards your friends and you'd rather not take the risk of letting them join, even if they happen to have the requisite skills? Are they still *entitled* to a "fair" chance?

Fairness also makes adding people much more cumbersome. My general philosophy for deciding whether I should add someone is by weighing the probability they contribute positively to the probability they contribute nothing or negatively. In other words, I evaluate each person on their own, first come first serve. [8](#footnote8)

This is an O(1) operation. If I don't compare any candidates to each other, then no matter how many candidates I have, they each take the same time. But in principle, if you wanted to be fair, you have to compare each candidate to each past candidate. That makes it an O(n) operation, where n is the number of people who have applied before. That doesn't seem very sustainable.

What's worse is that fairness constrains your decision making, and usually not for the better. Fairness requires you to be consistent with your past judgments. If your judgments and your values shift often, this is going to lead to outdated thinking. And if you're a teenager running an organization for the first time, it would be strange for your values not to shift often.

A counterargument someone could make is that you can be fair while still allowing yourself to update your thinking. But this requires active effort for very little gain.

In the same vein, people are scared of nepotism. They are afraid that it will be seen as unfair if they only invite people they are connected to. But the point of making connections is to use them. I don't think it's even unfair to give priority to the people you trust, because that's what sets them apart from any other potential candidates to begin with.

One egriegious mistake I see younger people make is just asking random people to help with their projects. By "random people" I don't mean asking someone they don't know; you should feel free to connect with people you haven't met before. I specifically mean posting on, say, a public forum and expecting to get a good amount of help from there. (Examples [here](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c1967976h2562710_explaining_alcumus_topics_ext), [here](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/q1h2364516p19278409), and [this entire thread](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c594864h1577227_recruiting_problem_writers_amp_testsolvers) .) I don't think this is the same concept as fairness, but the results look the same. You're inviting people you don't have any basis to trust, and that is a recipe for disaster.

A close cousin of fairness is democracy. Today, democracy is so embedded into our culture that nobody bothers to ask whether it's the right model for a certain situation or group. It's just blindly applied to everything. But governments and high school organizations are two entirely different beasts. The stakes are completely different, and so are the incentives.

In a government, we have democracy because it is in our leaders' self interest to screw over a large portion of the population. But no sane high schooler would screw over their friends because they'd be screwing themselves over at the same time. There is no such incentive.

Fundamentally, a democracy is based on the following principle: each person is equally invested in the results. The workings of your country, state, or city are influenced by the people in charge, so at least in theory, everyone casting a vote has done their due diligence and studied each of the candidates thoroughly. But high school organizations have to be built around [variations of investment](/essay/group). Some people are just here to help. Others treat it as one of their main responsibilities. It's because different people know how to do different things that we have to accept this situation.

A democratic decision-making process only inherits the harms: slow decisions and diffusion of responsibility. In addition, it is a huge obstacle to specialization.

In [Math Club](/essay/mathclub) I wrote about the importance of a *sense of urgency*, and the best way to bring it is through making small changes fast. Democracy doesn't fit this model. It's much better to have people openly making these small decisions - that way, if the decision doesn't seem small to someone else, they can speak up.

Democracy is ironically the biggest silencer of voices. Instead of organically discussing and debating proposals, any serious changes have to first be put up to a vote. [9](#footnote9) Democracy is a black box: many people show up, cast a vote, and leave, no comment. This is the worst possible situation. People should be expressing their ideas and concerns with words, not just votes.

This doesn't mean the one in charge should ignore everyone else's suggestions or never hold votes. Once again, there is a time and place for them. But be conscientous about holding votes. Are you about to make an important or difficult decision? And are you actually making sure people's thoughts and suggestions get included, instead of holding a vote for appearances?

Democracy also puts responsibility out of one person's hands and makes it very nebulous, especially when it comes to making hard decisions. If some person is responsible for doing the scary things, then they know they cannot rely on someone else to do it. They understand that the amount of work put directly translates to the output. When you have a democracy in charge of making decisions that haven't been made yet, then everyone is going to avoid bringing the issue up.
Say in some orgaqnization you have to hold a vote to get something passed. This diffuses the responsibility of showing up to the votes, as the blame of not showing up to the votes would not just on them. (Inevitably other people would start to miss votes over time.) If you're trying to get something done in this environment, you'll quickly notice that nobody is bothering to vote on your proposals. So why even try?

## Those Who Care

The somewhat obvious advice is to select for people who care. I have a couple of rough heuristics that I like to use, though your standards will differ depending on what and who you're working with.

My rule of thumb is that any potential member should be pestering you about your organization (or something related) in a productive manner. [10](#footnote10)

Let me give an example. One of my students frequently sent me ideas for geometry problems. I am not very good at geometry, so I couldn't solve most of the finished problems, and I couldn't find answer extractions for all of the incomplete ones; whatever little work I could do took very long. At some point I was unable to handle the rate at which I was recieving problems, so I invited them to MAC. Case in point: six months later, we are still recieving a large number of geometry problems.

I am aware that pester has negative connotations. But it really is the best word to describe the situation. Pestering implies that you're being contacted at a rate that you can't handle alone.

The best indicator for whether someone will care is whether they already do. With some experience, you'll be able to see who cares and who's ambivalent. From there, it's just remembering what to select for.

## Organizational Context

This dichotomy of "caring" versus "not caring" is not the entire picture. While some people are innately predisposed to care more, environmental factors are much more important. Particularly because they are all you can influence.

Make sure the way you are getting new people, if you even need them, is *warm* rather than *cold*. It is easier for people not to be invested if your relationship is established as "strictly work." Maybe that's unprofessional, but you're a high schooler. To hell with professionality; your business suits can come later.

Another assumption I've seen people make is that just because you worked well with someone in Project X, you two will work well in project Y. This is not always true. Specific environmental factors, which I call organizational context, will affect the way you interact. In adult society, your boss is your boss. You are socially and professionally subservient to them. But in high school, there is a unique situation: you can be someone's boss in one place and work under them in another! Your interactions in different groups will be surprisingly independent of each other. There've been times when I've been annoyed with someone in one organization and fine with them in another, and the difference in time is *a couple of minutes*. That is the power of organizational context.

That means you can't just be hard working or charistmatic to be an effective leader. You need to know how to set the organizational context, and above all, you need to be lucky enough to get the chance to set it in the first place. Otherwise, you can only hope that whoever steps up - if anyone - has the experience to do so.

So how do you set the organizational context? It's actually pretty simple: step up to do the work, don't bother with the formalities internally, but leave room for other people to do their own thing. [11](#footnote11) Above all, reach out to your teammates and get to know them.

All of this requires a great degree of trust. So when you're constructing your organization, make sure you're picking people you can trust and setting up a structure that you can trust to hold.

## Footnotes

<a name = "footnote1"></a> [1] And they wouldn't be wrong to think so.

<a name = "footnote2"></a> [2] In fact, one of the largest factors that make good technologies "good" is because it is very accessible. When I say accessible I mean "easy to maintain setup," rather than "easy for beginners to get into."

<a name = "footnote3"></a> [3] Not that sending no reminders or giving no assingments is a good idea. In fact, onboarding people with small tasks is a valid strategy. But people can tell whether they're being bullshitted versus whether they are actually doing valuable work.

<a name = "footnote4"></a> [4] You will see people citing "vision" to refute any reasonable suggestion to get people to care. Especially when it involves them becoming subservient to someone who they did not expect to work under: in other words, an outsider. There's a lot of ego that goes into being the one making big picture decisions. This isn't as one-sidedly bad as it seems though. There are times when you want to preserve your independence instead of merging into something bigger, and having an ego serves as a very good cover. I can say that this saved my organization.

<a name = "footnote5"></a> [5] I'm personally jaded with applications for a couple of reasons.

People usually open applications as a last move of desperation. Rarely do you see thriving organizations open them. (The exceptions are usually caused by significant public pressure or interest.) I see an obsession with applications as the symptom of a larger issue though. The reason applications usually fail is because some leaders are so obsessed with getting more people on their team they forget to work with their new recruits afterwards.

I've done fine without opening staff applications in MAST. Actually, there have been more people asking me for staff than I would accept in a round of applications, so I didn't need to create more interest there to begin with. But all of the staff have done great work as part of the team, so I do not regret adding any of them. I think it's notable that I haven't really had to prompt any of them to do work. (This is one of the reasons you should get people who care: they can lead themselves, and you get to spend less time on boring administrative stuff.)

Some readers will know I've opened applications in MAC before. To call a fig a fig, it was out of desperation. I just got lucky that it worked out well.

Just because you don't do applications doesn't mean you close yourself from the outside world. You still have to be proactive with talking to people, and you also should be willing to work with new people for the first time. The process just needs to be a little warmer than an application form and the rare "here is some work; go do it" email.

<a name = "footnote6"></a> [6] Taking risks is different from delaying the inevitable. I think it's a waste of time to sink your efforts into a dead or dying organization.

Whatever you do, don't try to get other people into joining your efforts. It wastes their time, and the last thing you want to do is waste other people's time. (This is a lesson I would do well to learn myself.)

<a name = "footnote7"></a> [7] The general rule of thumb I have for opening applications is this: Are you trying to expand or alter the scope of your organization in a way that your current "circle" of people cannot execute themselves? (Of course, you should make sure you have good reason for this expansion in the first place. But that's a topic for another time and place.)

<a name = "footnote8"></a> [8] This is not entirely true. Actually, I make the obvious decisions first - because I'm somewhat slow with applications, I want people with the highest probability of contributing to start working as soon as possible.

When I don't do applications, this usually manifests in the order I respond to people in. But this hasn't had a meaningful effect on me very often, mostly because people usually ask whether they can join MAC/MAST year-round, so the messages are quite spread out.

<a name = "footnote9"></a> [9] This implies anyone shows up for the vote. If your organization is dead, then people are going to stop suggesting things because nobody considers them anyways.

<a name = "footnote10"></a> [10] The "productive manner" is just to disqualify parents who ask you to tutor their child for free while insulting your teaching skills in the same breath. (Yes, this is a true story.)

<a name = "footnote11"></a> [11] I would be very surprised if you needed to actively try to give people room to do work. There are so many things to do you can't possibly do them all by yourself anyway. You just need to not get in the way of your teammates, which really should not be that hard.
