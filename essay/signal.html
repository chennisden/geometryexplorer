<h1>The Handcap Principle</h1>
<p><em>Originally published April [day], 2021.</em></p>

<p>In biology, the Handicap Principle states that costly signals must be reliable signals, as the signaller pays a price that an individual with less of a trait cannot afford. As an example, peacocks have large tails in order to attract females, despite that making the peacock slower and easier to spot.</p>

<p>In general, there are three requirements:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The two animals communicating must have a reason to decieve each other. (For example, males have reasons to present themselves as more fit than they really are in courting.)</li>
	<li>The signal must symbolize a trait adaptive to survival.</li>
	<li>The signal must be something that an "inferior" individual cannot replicate <i>because</i> of the costliness.</li>
</ol>

<p>This applies for humans too. Back in the Victorian Era, obese people were seen as attractive because it was a sign of having enough to eat to <i>become</i> obese. People then still knew obesity made you feel sluggish, but better to be rich and sluggish than poor and starving.</p>

<p>The Handicap Principle is still everywhere in our world. The reason school and grades exist isn't to benefit students. It's to force them to spend <i>time</i> and money to pursue something meaningless. The reason recommendation and reference letters are required is because it takes <i>time</i> to write them.</p>

<p>If people have the ability to survive in a senseless system, they do for a sensible system as well. But wasting people's time is not a good way to measure future success, especially because time isn't the only thing being lost here. When people are measured, the measurement <i>changes</i> them.</p>

<p>Throughout history people have been finding creative ways to defy biology. I have faith the same will happen here.</p>
