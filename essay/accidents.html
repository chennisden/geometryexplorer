<h1>Fortunate Accidents</h1>
<p><em>Originally published October 21, 2020.</em></p>

<p>I've often had people - and these are generally the more impressionable and younger members of the math community - ask me how they should go about writing a book or how I know as much LaTeX as I do. Along with these questions, I'll answer some that I wished people had been asked more often, such as how the JMC and NARML were written.</p>

<h2>Put Love in it</h2>

<p>Quite often, people have this misconception that just because you can do a large number of small and discrete tasks in a deliberate manner, somehow those can be strung up into something big that doesn't resemble Frankenstein's Monster afterwards. There is an old adage that "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts," but that goes both ways - just as you want to produce a meaningful work that challenges people to re-examine whatever you're talking about, you also have to put in a meaningful input to get the desired output.</p>

<p>This idea isn't even new or outside of popular culture; for however long, people have been calling this "putting love into it." And just because they can't explain exactly how you would go about putting love into something, it unfortunately gets dismissed. I think part of this has to do with what we're taught in school: first, that all you need to succeed is effort <a href=#section1">[1]</a>, and second, that this nebulous "effort" is entirely in your hands. We collectively are unwilling to admit that these chance encounters and uncontrollable factors play such a large role in determining how our lives pan out. You may recall being told to "try harder" or "be more creative" in school, but you will almost never be told "put more love into your work." And of course you're not putting love into your English essays. As fun as it might be for some people to write one, nobody is going to look back on their English essay and think, "Gee, how proud I am of myself for writing this." At best you get momentary pride from the grade you 'earn.'</p>

<p>I believe that the reason our youth are losing so much interest in work as of late is because they've never done a real long-term project before. In school, they do have group projects that last about a week, but even those are presented as the sum of many discrete tasks. When "big projects" are equated to standard busywork times some large constant, is anyone really learning? It should be no surprise that in school, math is seen as memorization instead of being understood as a framework; if kids are actively prohibited from pursuing this process of discovery and connections on their own, and we continue to hammer in the message that the world is well-defined, should we expect them to understand or even expect the existence of some underlying pedagogical structure behind what they're learning? I doubt so.</p>

<p>I blame this lack of long-term projects for the short attention spans that today's generation frequently get chided for. The insipidness of people's writing can also be traced back to this - you cannot write well without <a href="https://www.geometryexplorer.xyz/essay/flooding">brewing</a>, and that concept is so often ignored. The alternative is just believing that people are doomed to be stupid, and this stance lacks evidence, reeks of condescencion, and in any case, you should choose to bet on people having potential.</p>

<h2>Accidents</h2>

<p>I initially have called these things "accidents," but you don't entirely have no control over the ideas that you get in your head. The real reason social media is so damaging is because of the space it takes up in your head, not the space it takes up in your schedule. And unlike almost anything else you can get interested in, the only possible effects of thinking about the social media sphere are negative. While you can't change which opportunities come to you, you can change the ones that you see, and critically, the ones that you choose to act on.</p>

<p>These opportunities usually come in the form of ideas - sometimes well thought out, but often spontaneous. The reason opportunity is so valuable is because it is like a commodity; ideas are fundamentally tangible, and can be put to use. This is why you have to take care to <a href="/essay/log">keep track</a> of those potentially worth acting on, because while you'll encounter plenty of ideas, so few of them are meaningful. Just like how turning down work because you do not plan to spend money immediately afterwards would be stupid, you shouldn't neglect to keep track of promising ideas just because you won't act on them immediately. It is here where I disagree with conventional wisdom: The value of an idea is not solely determined by how you act on it. You will quickly see that dormant ideas do not all lie dormant forever, and that investing forty minutes in keeping track of your ideas is well worth the forty hours of meaningful work it will provide you. I've suddenly remembered and acted on so many ideas that I'd neglected to keep track of before - how many good ideas have I lost because I didn't just take the ten minutes to jot it down somewhere? <a href="#section2">[2]</a></p>

<p>Ideas, particularly good ones, often pave the way for more of them to come. It is often said that the hardest step in a journey of 1000 miles is the first one; the hardest word to write in a journey of 100 pages is also the first. Just like how each step leads into the next when you're running, good ideas lead into the next one when you're thinking; if you can chase this chain down, you'll make tangible progress remarkably soon.</p>

<p>I have talked to a surprisingly large number of people who sought to write their own book. I do not mean to discourage them, but I believe it is beneficial for them to get a clearer idea of what they're intending to get themselves into. The good news is that after the first ten pages, the rest follows pretty easily, but the bad news is this is where the running analogy falls apart. Unlike in running, when you can motivate yourself to take the first step by sheer force of will, you cannot do this with writing. Writing the first ten pages is extraordinarily hard, and you cannot force it. What people who try to force the first ten pages often do is clam up and act all defensive when questioned about the purpose of their work, claiming that their goal is some variation of "helping people." While such grand ambitions are noble, they are not unique and nor can they be acted upon alone.</p>

<p>Let me offer some concrete examples. For Proofs in Competition Math, some person asked Toller for help on a small handout, and soon the scope of it just naturally expanded on its own. For EEG, I played with the equivalent of the Inscribed Angle Theorem in Spanish class, did a little bit of research afterwards, and took some notes. As I polished them, I soon noticed that there was a lot more foundation to be laid and the content exploded. The MAST Compendium was born because of a number theory handout I wrote for a class (which I only expanded surprisingly recently) <a href="#section3">[3]</a>. Never did I sit down one day and decide "I am going to write a book because I just feel like writing a book (to gain clout, though I will not admit this to myself)." I felt compelled to finish the work I had started, and it is this compulsion that drove me to keep writing.</p>

<p>Of course, there is some level of skill involved here. This is why the best writers have so many works and can write so fast - they have a remarkable aptitude for recognizing good ideas, a stalwart persistence to push good ideas through (while knowing when to give up on a bad idea that slipped by), and the experience to facilitate the execution of their ideas.</p>

<h2>People</h2>

<p>Nobody, no matter how ambitious or intelligent, can complete a major undertaking on their own. Even works with one author have been influenced by those close to the author, so it is important to know smart people - preferably those who are smart in diverse ways. Just as you are the average of the 5 people closest to you, your work is the average of the work of the 5 people that influence you the most.</p>

<p>People like to think that they had a choice in who to be friends with and that it was due to their keen eye for people that their friends are so virtuous. Friends, however, are quite similar to ideas - a lot of people come and go, you actively seek those who strike you as interesting for some reason, and you actively avoid those who have few redeeming qualities or feel <i>off</i>. But further than that, you have little agency.</p>

<p>When it comes to group endeavors, it is who you know that counts. Your group will often form through the connections that people had formed long before. This is why it is so important to make friends with smart people and to be kind - if you need 6 people to form a group and start something, you would do well to remember than n+1 choose 6 is much larger than n choose 6, especially for big n. The formation of MAC <a href="#section4">[4]</a> could almost come out of a fairly tale. People who were teammates in past math contests roped each other in, and I joined by complete chance. <a href="#section5">[5]</a> The odds were so unlikely, but when everyone knew so many people, it shouldn't be surprising that something like JMC happened - though I maintain that our group gets along better than most "impromptu groups" that got together during the COVID pandemic.</p>

<p>Speaking of getting along with people, that may very well be the leading predictor of success for a group, not individual talent. It's fine if a group doesn't have remarkable individuals, because communication and efficiency overshadow this. Our group is able to run so well because we care enough to take the initiative, we trust each other enough that impromptu decisions can be made when needed, and we like each other enough not to make our conversations "just business." I do not think our individual talents played a very large role here. And just as unremarkable individuals have the capacity to produce something good, groups of talented individuals often are complete flops.</p>

<p>The truly unfortunate fact is that you cannot take a bad vibe and make it good, and creating a good vibe in the first place will happen only be chance. People are generally not great judges of each other, and if you do not have a prudent and cautious individual who happens to make their way to the helm, something good can be ruined extremely quickly. This is why preserving good relationships and starting on the right foot is so important; often times, people's first impressions of you will also be their last.</p>

<h2>Footnotes</h2>
<p id = "section1">[1] And if you're still not succeeding after putting in effort, you're just not trying <i>hard enough</i>.</p>

<p id="section2">[2] I also strongly advise carrying around a pencil and a small notepad wherever you go.</p>

<p id="section3">[3] If you want the full story behind the MAST Compendium, I strongly encourage buying it when it releases!</p>

<p id="section4">[4] This is the group that wrote the JMC.</p>

<p id="section5">[5] Officially, I decided to join just because I "felt like it," but I'm sure there was a part of me that told me it would be a good idea. I'm also glad that I listened to that part of me, because they were right.</p>
