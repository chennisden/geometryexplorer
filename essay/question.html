<h1>Usefully Asked Questions</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated September 21, 2020.</em></p>
<p>These are some useful questions that people have asked me. Some of these have been asked very frequently, and others are questions that I believe people would benefit from knowing the answer to (even if they don't ask the question themselves).</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>What's your background? Who are you?</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm Dennis Chen, sophomore, math enthusiast, and track/cross-country runner. (Unfortunate circumstances have left me unable to run cross country this fall.) Two-time AIME qualifier and USAJMO qualifier.</p>
<p>I liked the way your geometry book looks. How can I make something that looks similar?</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>I'm using a package called dennis.sty (developed for my own personal use). I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqM1bXg0ejM">video</a> on how to import it. I hash out some specific dennis.sty tips and general guidelines in <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h2203613p16617266">this thread</a>, though using the style file correctly is bound to be difficult, so I suggest you email me if you need further assistance.
<br>
<br>
While you're here, might I recommend <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chennisden/geometryexplorer/gh-pages/texmf/tex/latex/shooting.cls">shooting.cls</a>?
</li>
</ul>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>I liked the preview for your geometry book. Where can I get the full version?</li>
</ul>
<p>Nowhere, since as of right now it is not finished yet. If you take my classes you will be able to see more snippets of it.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Can you give me solutions to your mock AIME?</li>
</ul>
<p>Sure, just PM me on AoPS or email me. Unless if you want a solution to #15, in which case, see below.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Can you give me a solution to #15 on your mock AIME?</li>
</ul>
<p>Sorry, I seem to have misplaced the solution and forgot how to do the problem. I can tell you that the numerical answer is 19/30, but that's all that's in my notes.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Is the AMC class you ran going to rerun?</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="tinyurl.com/fallamc">Yes.</a> Expect future reruns as well.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Can I apply for MAST if I didn't make AIME/scored badly/etc?</li>
</ul>
<p>Sure. I'll accept you if you demonstrate through the Diagnostic that you've gotten better between the competition and now and that you're ready for the program.</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>How did you make this website?</li>
</ul>
<p>I wrote the HTML/CSS on this website myself. I learned some basic HTML/CSS on my own, using tutorials when necessary. I host on Github. The domain provider you use doesn't matter, but for the record, I'm using Namecheap. See <a href="https://github.com/chennisden/geometryexplorer">here</a> for my Github repository.
<br>
<br>
There are better people to ask than me though. If you want a website that actually <i>does</i> something, I recommend React. To put it mildly, I am no expert, so please ask someone else if you want to use React.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Why have some of your essays disappeared?</li>
</ul>
<p>The pages are still up (so as to not screw over anyone who's trying to link to it), for the record. I remove essays if I later determine that a) they don't say anything that's already been said or b) the writing is exceptionally slipshod. I don't <i>think</i> this will happen often.
<br>
<br>
The one exception is "Mass Appeal," and it exists only to connect to Math Club, so that's here to stay.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Can I talk to you/hangout/ask you a question?</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to slide into the DMs. I promise it won't kill you - after all, plenty of people have survived.</p>
