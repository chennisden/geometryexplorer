<h1>Design</h1>
<p><em>Originally published May 3, 2021.</em></p>

<p>Anyone who's been on my website for long enough will have seen <a href = "/texfiles/CV/cv.pdf">some</a> <a href = "/texfiles/cauldron/sanitized.pdf">of</a> <a href = "/pdfs/AQU-TelescopingNew.pdf">my</a> <a href = "https://mac.geometryexplorer.xyz/pdfs/narml.pdf">design.</a> [1] (Styles can all be found in my <a href = "https://github.com/chennisden/texmf">GitHub</a> under texfiles and texmf.)</p>

<p>I want to talk about a couple of design principles and pay homage to several other stylists.</p>

<h2>Principles</h2>

<p>These design principles are not "actual" principles. You will not find them on any document design course. These are just a couple of less obvious heuristics and observations that I have, but I think they've helped me achieve the designs I want.</p>

<p>The first is in terms of width: everything is page width minus margin widths. This may sound a bit obvious, but this isn't actually a hard rule. <b>Knowing this rule is what'll help you break it.</b> Campbell's Biology, which I think is a great example of document design, fills in their chapter headers with a rectangle the width of the entire page, <i>including the margins</i>. So does shooting.cls (which I do not have an example document of). But even in breaking the rule, designers adhere to it: the chapter title is aligned with the margins.</p>

<p>A useful way to gauge how much skill you have is how many degrees of freedom you can identify in design. Here are a couple, off the top of my head:</p>
<ol>
	<li><b>Colors</b>. This is the main way you can easily change the output of a style, and there are a large number of color themes you can choose from/create. My favorites are red + blue, red + blue + green, and purple + blue + green. [2] A really good color theme nobody has used yet is forest green, so I encourage any prospective stylists to start there.</li>
	<li><b>Box styles</b>. Do you fill in the box? Add extra decorations? A bit more technical savvy is needed here.</li>
	<li><b>Sections</b>. What symbol do you put in front of them? Where does the number go? Spacing?</li>
	<li><b>Fonts</b>. This requires a little more know-how. It's really hard to assemble a good repertoire of fonts, but I like Noto Sans, Merriweather Sans, Alegreya, newpxmath, and newpxtext.</li>
	<li><b>Innovation</b>. If you can invent your own ideas, you've basically created an entire degree of freedom. For example, the quotebox in my styles is one of the things that really makes them stand out.</li>
</ol>

<p>It's generally best to see these degrees of freedom as additive rather than restrictive. You should invent your own view and philosophy, because design is all about breaking the rules in smart ways. In that sense, none of this is advice - this is just an artefact of curiosity. What works for me may not work for you.</p>

<h2>Recommendations</h2>

<p>Whenever a non-designer wants to make a document that needs to look good, they usually use evan.sty. [3] There's nothing wrong with that, but I think it's also worth checking out some designs from other people.</p>

<p>For what it's worth, I think this is the first time a community of non-professionals have been making document styles. (Though it's admittedly pretty small, or the next paragraph would be a lot longer.) I hope this group of designers will continue to grow, and I am very excited for the future. Everyone on my list plus myself either didn't do design or was bad at it a year ago. [4] But people get good fast, and as more styles become open sourced, the barrier for entry only gets lower.</p>

<p>If you're looking for bright and colorful documents, why not try Dylan <a href = "https://github.com/Yu-Dylan/tex/blob/master/dylanadi/dylanadi_sty.pdf">dylanadi.sty</a>? I also really enjoy <a href = "https://github.com/SpacedInnOut/pdfs-and-stuff/blob/main/school/History_Notes.pdf">spaced.sty</a>. I'm sure there are other great styles, but many are not open source and I don't know all the high-school stylists.</p>

<h2>Footnotes</h2>

<p>[1] Anything that looks bad isn't up to date. (Obviously.)</p>

<p>[2] Extra credit for anyone who can identify where I used each of these color themes. </p>

<p>[3] Designers use their own styles.

<br>
A note to the designers: it's probably a good idea to try other people's styles, or at least look at them. I've been meaning to try out other people's styles, but I haven't really gotten the chance to.</p>
<p>[4] "A year ago" means a year from the original publishing date, not a year from whenever you're reading.</p>
