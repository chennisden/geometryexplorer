<h1>AMC Testing Strategies</h1>
<p><em>Originally published February 5, 2020.</em></p>

<p>Because I've gotten a lot of questions on "Hypermodern," a new moniker I coined for my AMC strategy, I'll take this essay to delineate my philosophy on AMC strategies. Strategy does NOT help, actually, and this is mostly an artifact of curiosity versus something I think will actually improve your score. I also think it's risky to switch strategies right before the contest, when you're most likely to start thinking about the different types of testing strategies - but if you are considering switching, it may help to know what the strategies are.</p>

<h2>Strategies</h2>

<p>Before I talk about Hypermodern, I want to cover two well-known strategies first: Classical and Reverse. Classical is what most beginners do; it is characterized by somewhat tightly going through the problems in order, being somewhat unwilling to skip, and going for less problems but making sure they are answered correctly. Reverse is as it sounds; you start from the end of the test, but because of the nature of the strategy, you need to be more willing to skip around and are probably going to sacrifice accuracy for more problems. [1]</p>

<p>On the 2021 AMC 10A, I solved 25 and none of 22-24 because I used a strategy I call "Hypermodern." It doesn't go as far as completely reversing the test, but it can give a good burst in motivation and is enough to shake your mental state up (in a good way). You have to be pretty experienced for Hypermodern to work for you, but if you <i>can</i> make it work, I think you can reap moderate benefits. [2]</p>

<p>In Hypermodern, you start at the beginning and go through the problems roughly in order, except you're not as careful as you would be in Classical and are more willing to skip around, returning to problems you were stuck on as soon as you've mentally "reset" for them. By "more willing to skip around," I mean <i>really</i> willing to skip around - for the first 15 problems, if I don't start making progress in the first 50 seconds or so, I will come back to it later. [3]</p>

<p>When you hit a wall at around 14-18, based on factors such as your skill level, the test, and the exact position of your moon, you go to #25 and start skimming the problems backwards until you land on something you <i>feel</i> that you can solve quickly. Then, when you're out of steam from working backwards or you feel like you've sufficiently reset (it is your choice as to which of the two criterion you use), then you go back to working in order again.</p>

<p>Hypermodern is designed around bursts of problem-solving and quick mental resets to keep you at the top of your game - though "designed" is a misleading word to use, as these benefits were naturally selected for, rather than being intelligently designed. <b>Only do this if</b> making mistakes on early problems is unlikely and checking isn't too efficient for you.</p>

<h2>3 Dimensions</h2>

<p>I think AMC strategies can be best categorized in 3 dimensions, as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li> Looseness - How long do you stick with problems? (Loose/Tight)</li>
<li> Order - How wonky is the ordering? (Wonky/Normal)
<li> Greed - How many problems are you going for? See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyBlQgzFwg">this OTSS video</a>.</li> (Horde/Conservative)
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<p>With the 3 dimensions framework, we can now precisely describe hypermodern: it is a Loose/Wonky strategy, and the greed is left as a choice. (The strategy I use is conservative hypermodern, if anyone's wondering.)</p>

<p>We also can now categorize some well-known strategies: Classical is Tight/Normal/Conservative, and Reverse is Loose/Mildly Wonky/Horde. [4]</p>

<h2>The Power of Strategies</h2>

<p>To reiterate: consciously and excessively thinking of strategies on or before the test is completely useless. It will not serve to improve your scores significantly; your time is better spent doing math. [5]</p>

<p>Particularly for those who are less experienced in math competitions, this discussion about strategies is misleading at best and can be actively harmful at worst. This is because you should basically always just do what's natural to you, as shifts in strategy are very hard to make work. For beginners, said natural strategy will almost always be Classical. My belief is that beginners default far too to the right in each of these axes; they are too unwilling to skip or jump problems, even with the option to come back to it later, and are too conservative with answering questions as a result. [6]</p>

<p>But for those who're more experienced and end up basically solving every question on the exam, why does doing the problems in a different order even matter? It seems like it just amounts to personal preference - and it does. But there is power in personal preference. The reason I do hypermodern is because I lose steam at around question 19 or 20 if I see something hard; to mentally reset, I go to the end and "start" the test anew. The reason I switch again is because reversing isn't personally sustainable, and the "break" in between a) nets me a couple more points and b) allows me to return to (roughly) doing the questions in order again. [7]</p>

<h2>Footnotes</h2>

<p>[1] Actually, most people that do reverse make a negligible sacrifice in terms of accuracy, which brings up an important point: The tradeoffs you make <i>change</i> as you get better at contest math.</p>

<p>[2] This is a big <i>if</i>.</p>

<p>[3] I am quite conservative though; after around 90 seconds or so, which is about one problem, I will immediately return to any skipped problems I didn't do. You could probably theoretically be more risky; you could skip problems for longer or even the majority of the entire test, only coming back during the last 15 minutes or so. I do not think this has a major added benefit and is <i>too</i> far out, which is why I have not done it.</p>

<p>[4] Exercise for the reader: Why is reverse characterized like this?</p>

<p>[5] However, I hope that with a more profound philosophy in testing strategies, that this can change - I do not believe that discussion about strategies inherently <i>has to</i> be useless. OTSS laid out some strong groundwork in 2020; perhaps someone can eventually take it further. This doesn't mean that you should spend a non-trivial amount of time to learn strategies - just that (I hope) taking the ten minutes to read this essay might actually give you something in return.</p>

<p>[6] The remedy, however, is not actively trying to shift left; it is just <i>practice</i>. Acquiring more content knowledge will naturally make you more daring.</p>

<p>[7] Some more trivia: I actually use Hypermodern on school math tests because even though the difficulty never climbs enough to challenge me (or even climbs at all, to be honest), they're so mindnumbingly boring that I need to Hypermodern to refresh myself. Perhaps it's become a routine at this point.</p>
