<h1>An Array of Numbers</h1>

<p><em>Those who presuppose, with a haughty attitude befitting one of their intellect, that a matrix is an array of numbers, ought not to speak about mathematics again.</em></p>

<p><em>First published on January 23, 2021.</em></p>

<p>As I sat in front of my computer screen chatting with my friends on Discord, berating a buffoon who made spurious claims about math education while explaining in a condescending manner that a matrix was an array of numbers, I wondered: Why was this misconception so prevalent? And why was it so damaging? Another day, I leafed through the pages of my writing notebook, thumbing through a number of essays I had been too lazy to type up. In it, I found a poorly written essay about a topic quite important to me: why were school assemblies about kindness so counterproductive? When I wrote the essay, what had I been trying to say? And what did matrices have in common with school assemblies?</p>

<p>The answer - and what this essay is about - is communication.</p>

<h2>Communication</h2>

<p>I've made it no secret that I despise the state of math education.</p>

<p>In fact, I'll go even further: <i>facts are only the medium through which a pedagogy is imparted through.</i> I'll provide a concrete example: angle addition formulas. Nobody in their right mind would think that it'll be useful in life. Nobody should expect you to memorize them without context.</p>

<p>And said context is a lot. To <i>prove the formulae</i>, you have to know the basic geometric rules <i>very well</i>: the sine area formula is required to prove the sine addition formula, and the cosine law along with the distance formula are required to prove the cosine addition formula.</p>

<p></p>

<p>And even if you put all these pieces together,  But in Algebra II and Pre-calculus, you are met with the following equations, sitting alone on a piece of paper with no explanation:</p>

<ul>
<li>
	sin(x+y)=sin(x)cos(y)+cos(x)sin(y)
</li>

<li>
	cos(x+y)=cos(x)cos(y)-sin(x)sin(y)
</li>
</ul>
<p>And that's if they even give it to you! Sometimes you'll just be expected to magically know the formulae from outside of school. Now all you're left with is two weeks to recite these formulae, and if you're lucky, such a problem won't pop up on the exam. It'll turn out that you'll be "lucky" more often than not, and this is not an accident or a coincidence.</p>

<p>Could you not see how such a system might be frustrating for everyone involved? There are the "dumb kids," who never had the chance to develop such an intuition about math - because their teachers didn't know how to <i>communicate</i>. There are the "smart kids" - who by a stroke of luck stumbled onto such an intuition - who have to watch the teacher squander all of the connections of the trigonometric formulae as he flounders around. Then there is the teacher who has to watch as he sees how little of a difference he's making - the "dumb kids" never catch up, the "smart kids" never care, and everyone walks out of the room having gained nothing.</p>

<p>You might think the solution is "just change the teaching strategy to encapsulate this," but it's not as simple as that - as evidenced by the petering out of New Math and the abject disaster known as Common Core. There are three important reasons for this:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<p><b>Teachers just don't know how.</b></p>
		<p>Is it any surprise that math teachers, who themselves haven't been handed this mindset, can't teach other people this mindset? [1]</p>
		<p>Fortunately, there is good news: just <i>explicitly knowing</i> something like this exists is probably enough to be able to teach it. The standard of "knowing" is probably higher than reading this essay, but I don't think it's too much higher.</p>
