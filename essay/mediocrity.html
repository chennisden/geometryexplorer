<h1>Settle For Mediocrity</h1>
<p><i>This is good work, but you should prioritize hitting all the requirements on the rubric.</i></p>
<p><em>First published February 21, 2021.</em></p>

<p>When I first published <a href="https://www.geometryexplorer.xyz/essay/whims">Whims</a> nearly a year ago, I had the seed of an idea that I wanted to put on paper (or more accurately, on a GitHub repository). Recently I've been engaged in a self-dialogue about the power of whims, why school and work feel so inefficient, and the secret behind the geniuses who seem to be able to complete so many large projects. So, in a way, this should be treated as a sequel to Whims - the essay that gives this topic the due justice it deserves.</p>

<h2>Bureaucracy</h2>

<p>I will state the most important implication of this section upfront: there is a reason that little worthwhile gets done in school, and it is because schools are forced to settle for mediocrity.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Schools by their design </p>

<h2>Irresistible</h2>
