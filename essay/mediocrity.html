<h1>Settle For Mediocrity</h1>
<p>"This is good work, but you should prioritize hitting all the requirements on the rubric."</p>
<p><em>First published February 22, 2021.</em></p>

<p>When I first published <a href="https://www.geometryexplorer.xyz/essay/whims">Whims</a> nearly a year ago, I had the seed of an idea that I wanted to put on paper (or more accurately, on a GitHub repository). Recently I've been engaged in a self-dialogue about the power of whims, why school and work feel so inefficient, and the secret behind the geniuses who seem to be able to complete so many large projects. So, in a way, this should be treated as a sequel to Whims - the essay that gives this topic the due justice it deserves.</p>

<h2>The Industrial Revolution</h2>

<p>The reason nothing gets done in school is because schools are forced to settle for mediocrity.</p>

<p>I am aware that this is a strong claim to make. But this is something that has inevitably occurred due to specialization, and the reason more people aren't opposing this is because it helps them survive.</p>

<p>We have to go all the way back to the industrial revolution, when public schools began. For most of human history, people worked in agriculture, only producing enough food to live on. There were few schools - children had to help out on the farm. So naturally, as the agricultural revolution (which uncoincidentally <a href="http://faculty.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/gclark/papers/prod2002.pdf">coincided with the industrial revolution</a>) began, food output increased by a lot - to the point where, for the first time, large parts of the population were free to specialize.</p>

<p>It is no coincidence that public education expanded and later became mandated during the industrial revolution. Yields in agricultural productivity <i>allowed</i> for public education to take root in our society. But the same forces that <i>allowed</i> for specialization also called for it.</p>

<p>The phenomenon of industrial moguls donating large sums of money to schools seens inexplicable. Biographies often present it as if to imply the generosity of its subject, or at the very least, to display how singular they are. But there's a very simple explanation for it: <i>education was required to train the workforce</i>, and the concept of supply and demand dictates that more well-trained workers equals higher productivity at a lower cost.</p>

<p>This isn't to claim that the rich who donate money to schools are malevolent or that this makes schools bad. <a href = "#foot1">[1]</a> The industrial revolution brought with it another change: the world is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvskMHn0sqQ">no longer a zero-sum game</a>. But there's a reason that industry - and recently, big tech - has been the biggest proponent of education, and to ignore it would be to allow education to serve the interests of the elite. It isn't enough for the interests of students and those running schools to <i>mostly</i> be the same. A small shift in the target <i>matters</i>, and this is the reason school doesn't exactly work for anyone, even if nobody can easily identify the reason why.</p>

<p>So who were the schools meant to work for? <a href="https://qz.com/1314814/universal-education-was-first-promoted-by-industrialists-who-wanted-docile-factory-workers/">Factory owners.</a> We have to look at every part of the schooling system with this lens. Why is the school day so heavily regimented, with harsh punsishments laid out for being late? <a href = "#foot2">[2]</a> Because the work day was like that in a factory. Why couldn't you run on the blacktop? Is bumping into someone and getting a scrape on the knee so dangerous? Of course not, but there is a place where you absolutely cannot be running around carelessly: <i>the factory</i>.</p>

<p>Why don't schools promote excellence as much as they should? Because in the industrial revolution, excellent workers were not much more efficient than competent ones. Though differences in productivity eventually got magnified, our 19th century mindset has not changed. There is a reason nerds are unpopular in school: they threaten the status quo.</p>

<p>If we look at standardized testing, it's obvious that schools are meant to produce a baseline of mediocrity rather than creating talent. You can't actually be telling me anyone believes <a href="https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/pdf/sat-practice-test-1.pdf">this</a> can tell you who's good at math. <a href = "#foot3">[3]</a> These standards are unequivocally too low, even for evaluating competence. <a href = "#foot4">[4]</a> But keep in mind that these math standards are too low for the <i>present</i>. They were perfectly fine during the beginning and middle of the industrial revolution, which is exactly when the public education system was constructed. College Board is still stuck in the 19th century, right where the rest of the education system is.</p>

<p>These connections are not some abstract idea. They are very real, and their effects are noticable. Think back to elementary school: no running on the blacktops, no doing anything but what the teacher tells you and when, and no going out to play until you're dismissed from your lunch table by the yard duty. Are these descriptors not out of place for a factory? In a factory, there's no such thing as "inspiring creativity" or whatever: you're doing the same thing over and over. School is the same way: <b>do it according to standard</b>. <a href = "#foot5">[5]</a></p>

<p>Report cards and grades have so often been characterized as "obedience letters" that we've forgotten something important: <a href="https://www.sanmarinohs.org/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=224107&type=d&pREC_ID=495320">"citizenship"</a> <a href="https://www.newberg.k12.or.us/district/new-elementary-report-card">grades</a> <a href = "https://www.redlandsusd.net/Page/12336">are</a> <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hC4m0tlK4CM2qgKjd8WJfermvWu7w59e/view">real</a>. This is very scary: trying to numerically evaluate the "social ability" of a child is already silly, but what's worse is these evaluations are taken at face value. We're enforcing discipline into our children at a young age: <i>but whose idea of discipline?</i> We're rewarding kids for being quiet, meek, and unassuming. There's nothing wrong with being any of those things, but if you aren't "normal" according to factory standard, school is going to make you suffer. Add to that the fact that "bad citizens" are often giving roundabout descriptors of their behavior for "political correctness," and it's little wonder that parents are disenchanted with schools. The only difference between the 21st and 19th centuries, it seems, is the lip service paid to the people the system hypocritically denigrates.</p>

<p>This isn't even a new idea. Anyone familiar with world history will explicitly be able to tell you why schools coincided with the industrial revolution. But we're treating this like it's just a historical tidbit.</p>

<p>Students are done some harm when schools teach them nothing useful. But it is much more harmful when their takeaway is that learning is "checklist," because checklist learning is boring. So some conclude that learning is boring, and rightfully so; little of value happens in a high school classroom. So the least we can do here is some damage control.</p>

<h2>Whims</h2>

<p>Consider the following picture: A high-school student is studying graduate level mathematics, spending time to work on a research paper. On the competitive level, they're in the top thousand high-schoolers in the nation. They have plenty of experience programming (for a high-schooler, anyway - four years isn't a whole lot of time to do anything), constructing their own databases, creating incredibly useful applications in the span of weeks, and designing <a href="https://everaise.org">beautiful websites</a> (sorry, I couldn't resist). They are moderately good at physics as well, being able to qualify the national olympiad. Above all, they are very reflective, being able to produce insightful writing.</p>

<p>This sounds like a prodigy, the mark of some highly competent polymath, but what I have just described is quite an average high-school student. Any average person - and this time I really mean average - would rightfully be incredulous and even mildly offended. But those of you in the respective contest scenes may be able to recognize the accomplishments described here, and while they are impressive, they are rarely <i>extraordinary</i>.</p>

<p> Part of the reason people are so humble about their successes is because there's only a few fundamental changes they had to make to get there. Success isn't some dish with arcane ingredients that only a select few have access to, or else we wouldn't see it pop up around the world. It's the creative use of familiar and available tools in order to construct something truly significant. If this sounds familiar, it's because math contests are very similar - high-powered theorems are fun to use and occasionally necessary, but you can do decently without them. Conversely, you can write astonishing problems with simple techniques. (I suspect the two are related).</p>

<p>The people that I'm describing are <i>polymaths</i>, in a modern sense of the word. Polymaths have been part of history since forever, before the industrial revolution or public education began. This is because of an old human force - whims.</p>

<p>The common model of studying is that you consciously decide to sit down and pull out your calculus textbook, setting aside time every day to work on it. <a href="#foot6">[6]</a> This model implies that Barry is better at calculus because he has more discipline and spends more time studying, and when you realize in some cases that's not true (there are plenty of Barrys who don't even open the textbook!), you come to an even worse conclusion: Barry is just naturally smarter.</p>

<p>Let me tell you a secret. None of the winners of X contest are all that disciplined. In fact, the type of people who win tend to have a very easy-going, independent nature with regards to their studying. <a href="#foot7">[7]</a> Self-control has some role in success. Smart people are probably more self-motivated than most others in some ways. But it isn't enough to account for such stark differences in achievement. Above all, self-control exists on a spectrum, while following productive whims is binary. The second better matches the type of distinction I want to draw.</p>

<p>So how do people really get good at something? It's because they're drawn to it. More specifically, they can't go a day without doing it. As an anecdote, when I went to bed the night before I typed up this essay, there were two things I wanted to get done: some programming and this essay. <a href = "https://www.geometryexplorer.xyz/essay/log">Ideas are like water</a> - if you don't store them somewhere, they will escape you - so it is only logical that I write this essay first. But I didn't do that. I ended up opening both Eclipse and Subl (the software I use to format these essays), but I programmed first, and for no other reason than "I felt like it." Conversely, I can "work" on homework for hours and get nothing done, even if logically it would take about 30 minutes. It isn't just the hours you put in that matters. It's the kind of hours you put in, and surprisingly, the time you put in because you "feel like it" is worth much more than designated time diligently spent.</p>

<p>You may notice that the math contest kids also do college math, programming, physics, writing, and whatever else. All the literary greats have produced dozens of novels. Senior developers have learnt a plethora of languages. <a href = "#foot8">[8]</a> This has only served to further the conception that some people are just more talented. But I don't think this is the case.</p>

<p>There's a lot of energy spent analyzing how <i>good</i> someone is and not a lot  To put it in math terms, people are spending a lot of time analyzing x instead of x'. The smartest fifth grader in your elementary school is maybe as capable as an average eighth grader. But give it a couple years and you'll see that there is no amount of time that will catch up to an intelligent high school or college student.</p>

<p>I think people understand this. That's why they care that X qualified for Y in Z grade. Not because Y itself is particularly notable, but because it's an indicator of where they will be in a few years. But few understand this well enough to apply it to themselves (or more frequently, their children). It's made more difficult by the fact that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVlR-5hS6f4&feature=emb_logo">the greedy algorithm does not work</a>.</p>

<p>People do not get their whims from nowhere. The first and most obvious ingredient is exposure. You don't need a lot of it, and it doesn't even need to be particularly good; even though AP Computer Science may be the worst designed abomination I've had the displeasure of laying my eyes on, it was enough to get me seriously considering creating an app, and it gave me the courage to follow through with it. <a href = "#foot9">[9]</a></p>

<p>A balance needs to be struck. We cannot <a href="https://www.geometryexplorer.xyz/essay/mathclub">allow lenience to reduce rigor,</a> and the current attempts schools are making to reduce stress - that is, giving students time to reach for their aspirations - are misguided because they do exactly this. But I think that the teachers who let their students make up tests for <b>full credit</b> have the right idea. There's no shame in doing poorly, and students end up learning more and analyzing their mistakes. Positive reinforcement is very powerful, and it's part of what shapes the whims people have. Lenience seems to be equated with <i>laziness</i>, which I think is quite a shame.</p>

<p>The second ingredient is the hardest one to reproduce. It is a personality type that naturally gets led around by the world. Polymaths did not one day <i>decide</i> to be fluent in Italian, physics, and mathematics. But this has led to the concept that polymaths are created out of thin air through mysterious and eccentric circumstances, which makes about as much sense as saying "<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/spontaneous-generation">germs are created out of thin air by dust</a>." Rather, polymaths are born because whims are not very consistent; for three months they may be interested in Java, then the next three they will intently be writing non-fiction, then summer rolls around and PROMYS or ROSS leads them to become intensely interested in number theory. Polymaths did not <i>choose</i> to have eccentric hobbies or a large corpus of information and skills. To them, it's like a force of nature: the sun rises, so a pencil does as well, and the moon phases, so interests shift as well.</p>

<p>When I was younger I couldn't understand how people got by without video games. I thought there was very little to do, and though I was brighter than most of my peers, I was only that - the best of my school. But once I started following my whims and writing about math - and quite poorly at the start, mind you - I immediately shot up to the upper echelons of the contest scene. <a href = "#foot10">[10]</a> I used to think that writing and reflection were the sole cause of this, but most people around me didn't keep personal sites with dozens of essays. Now I know that the people around me are so good because they did what they <i>wanted</i> to, often with just "what else am I supposed to do?" as their reasoning. <a href = "#foot11">[11]</a></p>

<p>What we're seeing here are two different types of people. It's the reason I can rarely hold a meaningful conversation with most of my classmates while being able to comfortably talk to some strangers, most of whom I will never meet. It's also the reason why successful people seem so intimidating from afar, even if they can easily make conversation with other people. And how <i>could</i> these two types of people communicate? They're speaking different languages. One of them believes the other is some sort of alien with endless wells of motivation, and the other doesn't understand why people are so impressed with them. <a href="#foot12">[12]</a> To them, they're just doing what they feel like, results be damned - but it is results they end up getting.</p>

<p>But this gap isn't unbridgable. Knowing the power of whims is the first step to harnessing them.</p>

<p>I've always been very apprehensive about "closing the achievement gap." It's like dousing a feverish child in ice-cold water. It only addresses the symptoms, does little to treat the causes, and ends up killing the patient. Now I know why: it's because this gap is made of the difference in <i>paradigms</i> between those who follow their whims and those who don't, but everybody <i>still</i> thinks that the conversation ought to be about test scores. And they're fighting a losing battle anyway, because technology will only cause this gap to grow faster. If 2020 has taught us anything, it's that you cannot win against exponential functions.</p>

<p>I do not think that people who understand the power of their whims deserve to be better off than the people who don't. This is why I'm writing this: because even though this won't be addressed on a societal scale, it can be addressed on an individual level. The two bureaucracies, school and work, have a large influence on us. But this influence can be overcome.</p>

<h2>Two Paradigms</h2>

<p>Up until now, I've described where this culture of settling for mediocrity has originated from: the industrial revolution. But none of this explains why it persists.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, it turns out that this is the result of two paradigms: one defined by successes, and another defined by failure.</p>

<p>This isn't to be hyperbolic or suggest that one model is better than the other. <a href = "#foot13">[13]</a> Each has its own benefits, and more importantly, people are allowed to pick and choose. You don't have to view the world through one paradigm, which is why it's important to be able to see through both of them.</p>

<p>The difference between each paradigm is a standard. A paradigm defined by success is one where failure is the default, and one defined by failure is one where success, to some extent, is the default.</p>

<p>You can see how certain careers will cause people to look at the world through different paradigms. Technology and scientific research are examples of success based fields, and professionals such as lawyers and doctors often view the world as failure based. This categorization is implicit in the way the public views these fields as well. If you were asked to describe Elon Musk, your mind would immediately turn to his successes: Tesla, SpaceX, whatever. A programmer would probably think of their coworker as "the lead designer for X," rather than "the guy who forgot" But you wouldn't describe your most doctors or lawyers this way. They're "reliable." You don't care that they treated patient X's condition (unless if said condition was extraordinarily rare or difficult to deal with). It's nothing out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>It's news when someone founds a successful company, discover the proof to a theorem, or create a new vaccine. It's not just because most people who try to do these things fail, and it's not because it's rare. These three all have one thing in common: they build up continuously, relying on the efforts of those that came before them. It's not like a legal case where there's a clear verdict in the end. It's because success is so nebulous that it becomes all the more remarkable when someone has clearly succeeded.</p>

<p>Obviously this categorization is not black and white. Programmers who consistently screw up are probably bad, and there are doctors and lawyers who have made names for themselves successfully handling difficult cases.</p>

<p>Different people might approach school with different paradigms based on their circumstances. A student who only gets A's will see anything less as a failure. It's possible that students who get B's and C's regularly will view the A's they get as successes. But even the C students have something they need to worry about: passing all their classes. Only the worst off truly have failure as a standard, and at that point paradigms of success and failure are by far not the most important thing they have to worry about. In that sense students can't escape a failure-based paradigm.</p>

<p>A failure-based paradigm is associated with settling for mediocrity, and the two have become the default around the world. This is because <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/wisdom.html">consistency was historically valued over peaks.</a> And what were the most desirable jobs in the last hundred years? They were mostly in the professions: being a doctor, lawyer, or some high-ranking employee in an established company. All of these are failure-based paradigms.</p>

<p>But this has changed recently. No longer are people satisfied with being a doctor or a lawyer. Now we want to change the world, and now it's becoming easier to do so. We're seeing a shift in <i>paradigms</i>, and there are opportunities to capitalize on it.</p>

<h2>Loss Aversion and Marginal Returns</h2>

<p>If we know the results of settling for mediocrity, why don't more people try to change it? There are a couple of reasons for this. One, there are times when it's best to operate in a failure-based paradigm. But perhaps the biggest reason is a psychological trait almost all humans share: loss aversion.</p>

<p>Let's do a quick exercise. For all the readers still in school: would you trade an hour of sleep to improve your grades? Probably not. But you wouldn't trade your grades for an extra hour of sleep either. This is an example of the endowment effect. Because losses loom larger than gains, people are generally unwilling to trade one thing for another of equivalent value. When the losses and gains are not well-defined, it's easy to ascribe a larger weight to theoretical losses and hard to do so for theoretical gains. People anticipate the former and do not expect the latter.</p>

<p>Reaching for success is also quite risky. In strictly monetary terms, almost nobody would accept a gamble that could make them exceedingly rich if it also had the chance to ruin them. People are not too thrilled at the prospect of living below their reference point, and for most of them, it's based on the environment they grew up in. And what's the reward in it? Perhaps being a billionaire is significantly different from living as a millionaire, but for most people, both ideas are so outlandish as to not even be worth considering. In general people are quite bad at predicting where they end up, particularly when success is largely defined by who you know and the kinds of chance encounters you have. It's no wonder people are scared of taking risks they don't understand.</p>

<p>This is why people who succeed almost always have a similar outlook on life. It is because this is the only way to motivate them to do good work. There is no logic behind reaching for excellence, so the only fitting answer is the one that refuses to abide by it: "I did what I wanted to!"</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>I don't believe that one model of success is better than the other on a personal scale. Even on the societal scale, professionals such as doctors and lawyers still have good reason to operate on a paradigm based on failures. I am not advocating that the rest of the world should take high-risk endeavors at the cost of security. <a href = "#foot14">[14]</a> But what pisses me off is when smart kids are forced to settle for mediocrity when it is clear that they have other goals. It's frustrating because they have no other choice.</p>

<p>We are training people to play it safe with the incentives we give early on in school and later in work. We are establishing mediocrity at the cost of a shot at excellence. And worst of all, we are sending the message that people who follow their whims are undisciplined, giving something like video game addicts as an example while failing to mention how powerful it can be when applied correctly.</p>

<p>Technology is an amplifier; it makes talented people thousands of times more productive than the average worker. But above all, the world is becoming a place where we can <i>afford</i> to lift people up after they've failed. The world is beginning to shift into a place where brilliance matters more than consistency, and where we are characterized by our best successes, rather than our worst failures. Perhaps it's time the central bureaucracies - school and work - start putting less an emphasis on ticking the checkboxes of mediocrity and more on substantiative <i>achievement</i>. After all, the richest people now overwhelmingly come from fields defined by success, rather than failures. The world is changing, and our institutions need to catch up.</p>

<!--mostly temporary to give me time to patch some holes up

<h2>Addendums</h2> 

<p>This isn't intended to insinuate that those who settled for mediocrity have somehow made the wrong choice. To be explicit, I am likely in the camp of people who have generally settled for mediocrity. It also isn't binary across time; sometimes people settle for mediocrity, and sometimes people follow their whims. In some respects, this isn't really even a choice; whether people do the project they've wanted to work on or finish their English essay is based on when the English essay is due. This also does not imply that one group of people are happier than the other. I was perfectly content to play video games and hang out with my friends when I was younger, and the hyper-capable people who follow their whims have very real self-esteem issues. But what I <i>am</i> claiming is that this choice has been partially taken away, and that that the counterexamples exist because selfless individuals who dedicate their time and energy to help others subvert this system exist, not because the system is secretly fine.</p>

<p>The reason I chose math contests (and whatnot) as an example is not because I think they're important. You can substitute "math kids" with "track runners" or "swimmers" or "band players" if you want. But STEM contests in particular are very hard to "fake it and make it" for long, which is why I picked them; in band you'll see many disinterested folks do four years for college, but this is much rarer in math contests/research. In fact, I think contests are a fun side diversion, but if your "whims" consist only of training to increase some score, you'll be in for a reckoning after high school, even if you like the process of training. I weakly think that "picking up the math contest book and doing problems because I can" is a good example of whims, but they may be somewhat unsustainable.</p>

<p>Some may believe that the takeaway is "look for your passion." That's not the takeaway, and I actually believe that it's bad advice. What I'm saying, at least with the "first ingredient," is to put yourself in the position to take as many chances as you can. More generally, I don't believe we do a very great job of giving people this exposure, and when we try it's often counterproductive.</p>

<p>Finally, there are some people who might say school doesn't inhibit them from pursuing their goals, or even actively helps them. To them I say, great for you, but not everyone is in the position to say the same. Nothing I've stated here is a hard and fast rule. It's a descriptor of a <i>trend</i>, so of course you can find exceptions; but that doesn't mean these exceptions render the general rule worthless.</p>-->

<h2>Footnotes</h2>

<p id = "foot1">[1] I'm not claiming schools aren't bad - anyone who's been on this site for long enough knows that I believe schools are deeply and fundamentally flawed, and any important changes that could happen on a systemic level have to be prompted to something akin to a force of nature. Nor do I believe that everything involved with school is bad - it just <i>is</i> by default, and specific conscious efforts have to be made on an individual level in order to combat that, with varying degrees of success. But "rich people donate money" does not seem like a convincing answer as to why. 
<br>
<br>
I also do not mean to say that the lives of people who can go to school are worse than those who cannot. But school is really just a symptom of the underlying forces that contribute to a higher standard of living, as the rest of this essay will show, and for those who can go to a "decent" school, it is quite easy to think of better uses of time; it does not require a particularly imaginative person to think of them. (Actually, trying to consciously <i>analyze</i> these better uses of time, or at least early on, might not be as good as just <i>doing</i> them; that's the idea behind whims.)
</p>

<p id = "foot2">[2] To be fair, said draconian tardy policies are rarely enforced. But the fact they're even there is a legacy of the industrial revolution.</p>

<p id = "foot3">[3] The relevant section begins on page 34, for those not familiar with American standardized testing.</p>

<p id = "foot4">[4] The problems are also poorly designed, but this doesn't have a deeper meaning behind it; the College Board is, by nature, not very conducive to good work. And it's not just the tests that suffer - try looking at <a href="https://www.collegeboard.org/">this</a> without wanting to take a fork to your eyeballs. If you read some of the reviews <a href="https://www.indeed.com/cmp/The-College-Board/reviews?ftopic=paybenefits">here</a>, it suddenly starts making a lot more sense. People want to survive, not thrive, and it shows.</p>

<p id = "foot5">[5] The major difference in schools now, at least in my experience, is that we are occasionally given designated free time to indulge in our whims. But I think it might be worse, particularly because it contributes to the misconception that indulging in your whims is bad and you should only get to do so as a special treat. We want people, when given enough time, to <i>eventually</i> sit down and do something meaningful for themselves, and I don't think the sort of toxic relationship with education that gets formed in schools is facilitating the process.
<br>
<br>
I don't mean to imply that fun should be banned. But if most days are dreadful and we only give kids designated time to enjoy their lives, it's a sign that the system is broken. Or, to be more accurate, it's accomplishing exactly what it was intended to: produce a large quantity of <i>adequate but not exceptional work</i>.
<br>
<br>
There's a lot of power in choice, and I'm convinced that it's possible to create an atmosphere where students would choose to study in a manner that's at least as good as what we have now. There's examples of this <a href="http://www.caccusa.org/school.php?page=cs_registration">everywhere</a>. Good programs and schools will inevitably still stick to a schedule, but we don't have to change to get rid of the more insidious effects of K-12 education. It's not that hard to make learning fun, and it's only because certain people turn a blind eye to how dull education is that we can't change the fact.
<br>
<br>
How did we get here in the first place, and why are we still here? Because we trusted large corporations and organizations to make decisions for us, often with no failsafes in case something went wrong. Schools are too centralized and bureaucratic. This has only been allowed to continue because of <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w19384/w19384.pdf">the endowment effect</a> combined with the fallacious belief that this centralization forces teachers to follow a certain minimum standard.
<br>
<br>
There's two things wrong with that: first, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-xpm-2012-feb-01-la-me-0201-teacher-20120201-story.html">these standards are never enforced to begin with</a>, and second, we can't apply standards to <i>people</i> the same way we apply standards to an office chair or a <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/8250.html">cup of tea</a>. (I kid you not! But I digress.) But my first point doesn't even capture the entire story; really, the standards are enforced only at the wrong times and never when they should be.
<br>
<br>
A plant's growth will not change whether you measure the number of leaves it has, its height, or its color. But people are changed by the measuring sticks applied to them. In some cases, no standard is better than a harmful one - and this is one of them.

<p id = "foot6">[6] This isn't to say that scheduling isn't a powerful tool, but it doesn't make up for an absolute disinterest in a subject.</p>

<p id = "foot7">[7] Unfortunately, not all my friends <i>get</i> this sort of academic independence. But I think I speak for all of them when I say they would prefer it, and most of them would probably be better off with it.

Being a "tiger parent" is not a good idea, especially when your child is already quite successful; any success they find is in spite of an overbearing attitude, not because of one. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVlR-5hS6f4&feature=emb_logo">Zuming Feng</a> speaks on this subject much better than I ever could.

<p id = "foot8">[8] Interestingly enough, if you substitute "senior developer" with "multilinguals," the sentence is still completely true.</p>

<p id = "foot9">[9] This is a part of privilege I think doesn't get discussed enough: the freedom to follow your own whims. Certain political groups keep talking about the necessity of providing "opportunities" to everyone without even thinking about why they should be doing it in the first place.

<br>
The answer? It's to give people the freedom to discover and follow their own whims. People are surprisingly capable when they put their minds to it, so we need to work on facilitating that last bit.</p>

<p id = "foot10">[10] Writing taught me to <a href="https://www.geometryexplorer.xyz/essay/sort">sort</a> all the concepts in my head, but the only reason it was able to do that was because I was following my whims. I would not have succeeded if I did it solely to "get into USAJMO." Otherwise, everyone who took notes on their biology textbook would be able to pass all the tests with flying colors, and the average test score wouldn't be sixty-something.</p>

<p id = "foot11">[11] On the flip side, sometimes I think these whims can be too powerful; math and programming have produced some of the youngest workaholics to date.</p>

<p id = "foot12">[12] More accurately, they wonder "why does it seem like nobody else is competent at this?" (I'm not the first to say this, but I've forgotten the source.) To them, what they're doing doesn't feel out of the ordinary. Anyone decently capable should be able to do the same. They're right about that, but there are so many things worth doing well that not everyone can get to learning X niche, which is how it becomes a niche in the first place.</p>

<p id = "foot13">[13] To be more precise, the better paradigm is a product of the time and environment someone lives in, as well as the career they intend to pursue. It is not the same for everyone. But on average, we are seeing that success-based paradigms are starting to gain more traction. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=motivational+posters&client=firefox-b-1-d&sxsrf=ALeKk01Se07dEdBaMY362lhtH63ScSCrMA:1615931979761&source=lnms&tbm=isch&biw=1490&bih=925">We're already seeing its side effects.</a></p>

<p id = "foot14">[14] The two obvious ones that come to mind are doctors and lawyers. But based on the prevalence of Java, we can begin to see that this mindset has made its way into part of the programming industry. For those of you who see the connection between the industrial and technological revolutions, this should not be too surprising.

This isn't meant to disparage Java programmers. I'm a Java programmer myself. But Java is designed to protect people from themselves. This is part of what makes it so accessible, but I also fear it is becoming an end-all be-all for some.</p>
