  <h1>Mass Appeal</h1>
  <p><em>Originally published October 4, 2020.</em></p>

<h2>Oversaturation</h2>

<p>The media produced today, particularly in YA novels and reality TV, has become bland and repetitive to the point of oversaturation. We are seeing the same tired and artificial tropes and plot points pop up again and again to the point where each show or novel is indistinguishable from the next, each of them lacking any form of personality.</p>

<p>It is not very surprising that most media is insipid, because most thoughts (and indeed, most people) are vacuous. But what is somewhat surprising is the recent success that these books and shows have been receiving. In fact, this bizarre phenomenon has become so widespread that it has spawned a name for itself: mass appeal.</p>

<p>Shows designed to have mass appeal are so successful because they exploit humanity's yearning for comfort and familiarity, particularly in a world that is changing so fast. But in doing so, these producers end up shooting themselves in the foot; people generally do not feel strongly about phenomena they have observed and experienced frequently, because it is the surprise and novelty of good works that cause most people to consider them to be good. These shows are not the type to get recommended by friends and acquaintances; they are the shows that, despite their statistical success, largely lurk in the background of the collective conscience. This is because few people really like the show, and the show is only able to be financially viable because a disinterested viewer is worth as much as a passionate viewer when it comes to ratings. Indeed, these shows only put in the minimum amount of effort to get as broad of a base as it can, extending its reach without ever considering the potential consequences of this reach.</p>

<p>It is ironic, however, that the most reliable way to make a show or novel that stands the test of time is to make a truly meaningful and compelling narrative. But the same vapidity that allows these authors and producers to create such superfluous media and bask in their fifteen minutes of fame also prevents them from creating a memorable and insightful story. In attempting to make a work reach as many people as it can, its producers often sacrifice any possible insight the work could've brought out, and lose the interest of the more thoughtful potential audience. At the end of the day, the authors who can reject the notion of mass appeal are the only ones who can tell a story worth reading.</p>

<h2>Edginess</h2>

<p>Given the distaste that many have now acquired for media with mass appeal, many have now taken pains to specifically cater to a niche, deliberately reducing the size of the audience their work could appeal to. This phenomenon also has a name - edginess - and the juvenile and shallow understanding that many have of it is why it has been able to continue until now. Edginess is when a work deliberately reduces the potential reach that it could have without benefiting the narrative (and often, it works to the detriment of the story).</p>

<p>We as a society understand that it does you no good to live life to please others at a cost to yourself. But at the same time, we understand that there is no reason to be deliberately or unnecessarily rude and aggressive, and the distastefulness that these people display is rarely overlooked. It is the same in fiction; you should not please the masses at a detriment to the story you're telling, but at the same time, it is unnecessary to deliberately be over the top in avoiding being a people pleaser, because that will also work against you.</p>

<p>In fact, the easiest way to reduce the number of people your work appeals to is to eliminate all nuance. That way, anyone who believes or behaves differently from your protagonist turned author surrogate will be filled with an intense dislike for your work. Clearly this is not a desirable result, so it is necessary to avoid the concept of mass appeal as much as possible, since becoming overly conscientious of it either way will not end up well.</p>
