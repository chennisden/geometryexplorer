<h1>Friends</h1>
<p><em>Originally published on March 23, 2021.</em></p>

<p>I used to think that the defining characteristic of my friends was that they were smart. But I recently realized that isn't precise enough a descriptor. It is true that all my friends can be classified as "smart," but it's also true that all of my friends can be classified as "human beings" or "members of kingdom Animalia." And "smart" is an especially bad categorization because most people are smart in some way, so it just ends up being equivalent to whether you can see something in someone. This is a necessary condition for friendship, but hardly a surprising one.</p>

<p>I'm convinced the real difference is craziness.</p>

<p>Every year there's always a class of people that I feel out of place in.</p>

<p>In popular culture the nerds are always the quiet and meek kids. </p>

<p>Maybe this is true from an outsider's point of view. In fact, I would suspect this is the case. This stereotype wouldn't last long if people outside didn't have good reason to believe it.</p>
